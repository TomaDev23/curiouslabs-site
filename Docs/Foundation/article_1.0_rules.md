# üß≠ CuriousLabs Landing Page ‚Äì Cursor Mission Context

## üéØ Mission Objective

Build a **modern, elegant, AI-native landing page** for **CuriousLabs**, an elite CodeOps service lab.  
The site will showcase:
- Services (AI-enhanced debugging, testing, security, docs)
- Real case logs (CLI + markdown)
- Mission intake form (submit error/test ‚Üí return TILE)
- Visual identity aligned with hacker/elite/code lab aesthetics

Primary stack: **React + TailwindCSS**, built inside **Cursor** using image-to-code prompt engineering.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Execution Rules (Do Not Deviate)

- ‚ùå **Do NOT** use templates or external component libraries (no Bootstrap, no MUI)
- ‚úÖ **Use only TailwindCSS** utility classes (`text-5xl`, `bg-gradient-to-r`, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Each section must be modular and exportable as a standalone component
- ‚úÖ All mission logic (submissions, approvals) is **not active** ‚Äî stubbed or visual only
- ‚úÖ Buttons and forms must be styled and laid out, but do not need backend integration yet
- ‚ùå Do not add random animations, overlays, or illustrations without command
- ‚úÖ Layout fidelity must be **as close as possible to the uploaded screenshots**
- ‚úÖ Mobile responsiveness is required via Tailwind breakpoints (`sm:`, `md:`, etc.)
- ‚úÖ File/folder structure must be clean and production-aligned:
  - `components/Hero.jsx`
  - `components/Services.jsx`
  - `components/Testimonials.jsx`
  - `pages/index.jsx`

---

## üìÅ Reference Assets

- ‚úÖ Uploaded UI screenshots (6 PNGs)
- ‚úÖ MidJourney prompt packs for visual hero sections
- ‚úÖ Service descriptions and mission logs (to be inserted later)
- üß† Tagline: _‚ÄúYou send a mess. I return a TILE.‚Äù_

## üîí Scope Control

| Feature                  | Status       | Notes                          |
|--------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| Hero + Tagline           | ‚úÖ Required   | Primary branding section       |
| Services Grid            | ‚úÖ Required   | Must match 2-column layout     |
| Logos / Partners Strip   | üü¢ Optional   | Use dummy logos for now        |
| Testimonials             | ‚úÖ Required   | 3-card slider or static blocks |
| Mission Logs (Case MDs)  | üü¢ Stubbed    | Will be added post-build       |
| Form Submission Flow     | üü¢ Stub Only  | Structure only, no backend     |
| Responsive Layout        | ‚úÖ Mandatory  | Mobile-first via Tailwind      |
| Code Clarity             | ‚úÖ Required   | Must pass ESLint + be readable |

## üì¶ Final Output

- All components rendered in Tailwind/React
- One scrollable landing page (can later be split into routes)
- `.md` version of this file included in `/docs/PRD_curiouslabs_landing.md`
- Screenshots archived in `/assets/ui_refs/`

## üìú Last Directive

> Treat this site as **the external face of an elite tactical dev lab**.
> It must feel smart, clean, fast ‚Äî like code that could write code.

### Analysis Output Template
```
## üìä Current State Audit

I've analyzed the requirements and resource files for [TILE].

### Target Files:
- Source: `[source_file_path]` 
- Test: `[test_file_path]` (to be created/modified)
- Contract: `[contract_file_path]` (to be created/modified)

### Key Requirements:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
- [Requirement 3]

### Coverage Requirements:
- Target: ‚â•[X]% coverage
- [Specific testing requirements]
```

## üß† Phase 2: Simulation

### Simulation Process
1. Draft implementation structure (method signatures, class relationships)
2. Outline test cases with expected behaviors
3. Identify potential implementation challenges
4. Create a contract draft if required

### Simulation Output Template
```
## üß† Mission Simulation

### Phase 1: [Component] Implementation
```python
# [Brief implementation snippet]
```

### Phase 2: Test Implementation
```python
# [Brief test snippet]
```

### Phase 3: [Additional phases as needed]
```

## ‚ùì Phase 3: Question Formulation

### Question Categories
1. **Implementation Clarity**: Questions about ambiguous requirements
2. **Integration Points**: Questions about how components interact
3. **Edge Cases**: Questions about handling exceptional scenarios
4. **Validation Criteria**: Questions about success verification

### Question Template
```
## ‚ùì Questions Before Execution

1. **[Category]**: [Specific question about implementation detail]?

2. **[Category]**: [Specific question about architecture]?

3. **[Category]**: [Specific question about validation]?
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Phase 4: Plan Presentation

### Plan Components
1. Detailed step-by-step implementation sequence
2. Tool commands with exact syntax
