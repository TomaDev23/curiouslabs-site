# 👝 CuriousLabs Landing Page – Cursor Mission Context

## 🌟 Mission Objective

Build a **modern, elegant, AI-native landing page** for **CuriousLabs**, an elite CodeOps service lab.  
The site will showcase:
- Services (AI-enhanced debugging, testing, security, docs)
- Real case logs (CLI + markdown)
- Mission intake form (submit error/test → return TILE)
- Visual identity aligned with hacker/elite/code lab aesthetics

Primary stack: **React + TailwindCSS**, built inside **Cursor** using image-to-code prompt engineering.

## ⚙️ Execution Rules (Do Not Deviate)

- ❌ **Do NOT** use templates or external component libraries (no Bootstrap, no MUI)
- ✅ **Use only TailwindCSS** utility classes (`text-5xl`, `bg-gradient-to-r`, etc.)
- ✅ Each section must be modular and exportable as a standalone component
- ✅ All mission logic (submissions, approvals) is **not active** — stubbed or visual only
- ✅ Buttons and forms must be styled and laid out, but do not need backend integration yet
- ❌ Do not add random animations, overlays, or illustrations without command
- ✅ Layout fidelity must be **as close as possible to the uploaded screenshots**
- ✅ Mobile responsiveness is required via Tailwind breakpoints (`sm:`, `md:`, etc.)
- ✅ File/folder structure must be clean and production-aligned:
  - `components/Hero.jsx`
  - `components/Services.jsx`
  - `components/Testimonials.jsx`
  - `pages/index.jsx`

---

## 📁 Reference Assets

- ✅ Uploaded UI screenshots (6 PNGs)
- ✅ MidJourney prompt packs for visual hero sections
- ✅ Service descriptions and mission logs (to be inserted later)
- 🧠 Tagline: _“You send a mess. I return a TILE.”_

## 📦 Final Output

- Screenshots archived in `/assets/ui_refs/`

## 📜 Last Directive

> Treat this site as **the external face of an elite tactical dev lab**.  
> It must feel smart, clean, fast — like code that could write code.

End of Brief.
