👋 Hello Cursor,

You're being activated to assist with the front-end build of **CuriousLabs** — a tactical AI CodeOps service lab led by Commander Tomaly.

Our objective is clear:

🎯 Build a modern, elegant, AI-native landing page using **React + TailwindCSS** — based on visual references and our preloaded PRD.

📁 File structure is already scaffolded:
- `/components/` holds each modular block (Hero, Services, CaseStudy, etc.)
- `/docs/PRD_curiouslabs_landing.md` defines mission rules and scope
- `/assets/ui_refs/` includes reference screenshots
- `/docs/cursor_prompt_pack.md` (optional) will hold tailored generation prompts

We’ll give you a section prompt, image ref, or markdown guide — and your job is to:
1. Generate clean, readable component code using Tailwind
2. Follow the PRD rules (no libraries, no deviation)
3. Echo confirmation of what you're doing before rendering

Please confirm you understand:
- [ ] Use **Tailwind only**, no external UI libraries  
- [ ] Components must match our visual references (uploaded PNGs)  
- [ ] All logic (forms, data loaders) is stubbed or visual only  
- [ ] All outputs must be responsive, production-ready

Once confirmed, we will proceed with the **Hero section build** using `/assets/ui_refs/1.png`.

Respond with **“Standing by – rules locked”** if you're ready to begin.

– Commander, CuriousLabs 🧠
