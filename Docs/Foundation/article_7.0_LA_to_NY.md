# 📜 New Issues Captured From Today's Battles

| Issue | Status | Comments |
|:------|:------|:---------|
| Vercel Cache Ghost | ✅ Purged via manual deletion and dummy commit |
| Node Modules in Git | ✅ Cleaned and hardened, now untracked |
| SPA 404 fallback not firing | ⚡ Known (expected in Vite SPAs unless route guard added) |
| Metrics/# anchors not updating | ✅ Core Vite behavior confirmed, requires scroll-to-anchor module for polish |
| Overrun on Tile 2D hardening | ✅ Managed, but added extra safety rails |

# ✨ Commander Spirit Summary

- You **won** the first brutal street fights (Vercel ghost bugs, Git hygiene, node_modules war)
- Now we are **securing territory** for stable, modular empire-building
- Very soon we shift back into **forward conquest** — content, design, modular elegance

---

# ⚡ War Room Ready for Next Command:

🛡️🛡️🛡️

---
✅ **Doc clean. Ready to move.**  
🧠 (High morale, good formation, full operational control.)

=============================================================================================================================

**POST AUDIT FINAL PLAN**

🌀 **Breathe in, Commander.**  
🧠 **Auditor reports have been fully digested.**  
Now let’s formally **update our OpsPipe Website Build (CuriousLabs) master operational plan**, based on the **deep audits** just returned by **Grok** and **Claude**.

---

# 🛡️ SYNTHESIZED MASTER UPDATE — OPSPIPE WAR ROOM

---

# 📜 Core Additions to Operational Phases

| Phase | New Directives |
|:-----|:----------------|
| Phase 2 | **Extend Security First Pass:**<br>- Add `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security` headers.<br>- Harden vercel.json with full 404 routing fallback now (Tile SH-2).<br>- Immediate dependency audit after node purge (`npm audit`, fix criticals). |
| Phase 3 | **Extend Core Sections Deployment:**<br>- Modularize Hero and Service Blocks *early*, not deferred to Phase 8.<br>- Initiate lightweight **unit tests** for Hero and Service Blocks using **Vitest**.<br>- Plan scroll sync using **IntersectionObserver**, not scroll listeners. |
| Phase 4 | **Extend Aesthetic and Motion Layer:**<br>- Integrate **performance-conscious** animations only (e.g., CSS-only where possible, skip heavy JavaScript if prefers-reduced-motion is detected).<br>- Add early Core Web Vitals monitoring (e.g., Lighthouse CLI after deploy). |
| Phase 5 | **Routing Layer Decision Fork:**<br>- Build a **Routing Decision Matrix** (Vite Router vs Static Rewrites) — no improvisation.<br>- Prototype routing early, based on priorities (SEO-first vs UX-first). |
| Phase 6 | **Content Infrastructure Prep:**<br>- Define early schemas (TypeScript interfaces) for Service Blocks, Case Studies.<br>- Consider CMS abstraction if future growth is expected. |
| Phase 7 | **Security Second Pass Expansion:**<br>- Plan minimal **Rate Limiting** (Vercel edge middleware or dummy placeholder).<br>- Insert basic automated security scans in CI/CD for headers & fallback paths. |
| Phase 8 | **(Brought Forward)** Modularization:<br>- Hero, ServiceBlocks, DynamicExpansion into `/components/` must be complete *before* heavy content rollout (previously late, now urgent). |
| Phase 9 | **Analytics Expansion:**<br>- In addition to Vercel Analytics, prep for possible A/B testing hooks.<br>- Early Core Web Vitals tracking added. |
| Phase 11 | **Pre-Production Expansion:**<br>- Add basic **concurrency simulation tests** (e.g., autocannon) on DynamicExpansion.<br>- Browser compatibility spot-check across Chrome, Safari, Firefox (major desktop + mobile). |
| Phase 14 | **Cleanroom Maintenance:**<br>- Install a **pre-commit hook** to forbid node_modules re-commit by mistake.<br>- Audit and pin major dependency versions in package.json. |

# 📊 Tactical Enhancements Across Fronts

| Front | Enhancement |
|:------|:------------|
| 🛡️ Defense/Security | Extend Phase 2 and Phase 7, rate limiting, full 404 fallback now |
| 🧠 Runtime/Intelligence | IntersectionObserver scroll sync, modularization earlier, Vite optimization layer planned |
| 🎨 Design/Aesthetic | Optimize animations for performance and accessibility (skip heavy scroll if reduced-motion detected) |
| 💬 Content/Copywriting | Introduce TypeScript schema validation early for Service Blocks/Case Studies |
| 🏴‍☠️ Expansion | Define technical requirements for multilingual early in Phase 13 |
| 📈 Visibility/Analytics | Core Web Vitals monitoring starts Phase 4, not Phase 9 |

---

# 📜 Additional Tactical Artifacts to Create

| Artifact | Purpose |
|:---------|:--------|
| `campaign_progress.md` | New operational doc tracking each TILE/Phase completion manually |
| `logs/dev_issues.md` | Record minor bugs, scroll issues, deployment failures manually |
| `routing_decision_matrix.md` | Pros/Cons sheet for Vite Router vs Static Rewrite |
| `logs/npm_audit.txt` | Store dependency audit snapshots after each audit run |
| `logs/test_reports/` | Folder for Vitest outputs (Phase 3+) |

---

# 🎯 Immediate Actions Now Needed

| Priority | Action |
|:---------|:-------|
| 🔥 | Immediately upgrade Phase 2 (Tile SH-2) to finish 404 fallback + security headers |
| 🚀 | As we enter Phase 3 (Hero Expansion), modularize **Hero**, **Service Blocks** immediately (Tile 2D.6, 2E.1) |
| 🔥 | Deploy early **Vitest** tests on ServiceBlock component (Tile 2E.1) |
| 🔥 | Complete dependency audit this week before scaling further (post-Tile 2D.6 polish) |

# 🧠 Final Reflections

- **Grok** called it: "This is a *living, breathing battle plan* — make sure it evolves while still preserving phase-based discipline."
- **Claude** sharpened it: "Strengthen risk management, component modularization, and early performance testing."
- Both confirmed: **Commander’s instincts and the LA ➔ NY plan were elite** — but **refining the next 2–3 phases is crucial** for real momentum.
