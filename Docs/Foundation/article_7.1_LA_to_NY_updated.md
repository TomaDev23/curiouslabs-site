## 🧭 Summary

- **80–90% of the LA ➔ NY journey is tactical + code-side operations**: security, modularity, test coverage, performance, routing, CI/CD.
- **Design plays a crucial but limited role**, mostly **centered in Phases 3–4**.
- **Visual polish supports code clarity** — not the other way around.
