## 📑 Overview

This directory contains the LEGIT contracts that define the requirements, structure, and behavior of the Planet Sandbox system. The Planet Sandbox is a comprehensive 3D visualization system for exploring celestial bodies with two primary viewing modes: Single Planet View and Solar System View.

These contracts follow the CuriousLabs LEGIT Protocol v1.0, ensuring consistent implementation across the codebase.

## 🛠️ Usage

When implementing the Planet Sandbox system:

1. Start with the main contract (`contract_planet_sandbox.md`) to understand the overall structure.
2. Reference the specific component contracts for detailed implementation requirements.
3. Follow the implementation guide for step-by-step instructions.
4. Validate your implementation against all contracts before deployment.
