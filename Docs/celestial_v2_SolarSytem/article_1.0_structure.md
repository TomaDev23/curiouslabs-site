# Planet Sandbox Page Structure Analysis

After examining the planet-sandbox.jsx file, here's a detailed breakdown of its architecture, layers, components, and controllers:

## Layers & Z-Index Hierarchy

1. **Base Layer (z-0)**
   - The Three.js Canvas with the 3D scene, fixed positioning with `inset-0`
   - Contains all celestial bodies and lighting

2. **UI Control Layer (z-50)**
   - Controls panel (top-left)
   - Planet information panels
   - Zoom target selector (bottom-center)
   - All UI elements use `bg-black/70` for semi-transparent backgrounds

3. **Planet Selector HUD Layer**
   - `PlanetSelectorHUD` component imported from `../../components/hud/PlanetSelectorHUD`
   - Only shown in single view mode

## Core Components

### 1. Main Page Component
- `PlanetSandboxPage` - Root component that orchestrates the entire page
- Manages view modes, planet selection, and UI states

### 2. Specialized Components
- `RotatingCamera` - Handles camera rotation when orbit controls are disabled
- `SolarSystem` - Manages the solar system view with proper planet positioning 
- `PlanetSelectorHUD` - External component for planet selection and lighting controls

### 3. Planet Components (Imported)
All planets are imported from the celestial bodies directory:
- `MarsSphere`
- `JupiterSphere`
- `PlutoSphere`
- `SaturnSphere`
- `UranusSphere`
- `VenusSphere`
- `MoonSphere`
- `EarthSphere`

## State Management

The page uses multiple React state hooks to manage:

1. **View State**
   - `selectedPlanet` - Current selected planet in single view
   - `viewMode` - Toggle between 'single' and 'solar-system' views
   - `zoomTarget` - Current focus planet in solar system view

2. **Lighting State**
   - `ambientIntensity` - Controls ambient light strength
   - `sunIntensity` - Controls directional light (sun) strength
   - `sunColor` - Controls color of the directional light
   - `directionalPos` - Fixed position for directional light

3. **Control State**
   - `orbitEnabled` - Toggle for orbit controls
   - `autoRotate` - Toggle for camera auto-rotation
   - `showInfo` - Toggle for planet information panels

## Three.js Integration

1. **Canvas Setup**
   - Uses `@react-three/fiber` Canvas with `preserveDrawingBuffer: true` for screenshots
   - Custom camera positioning with `position: [0, 0, 3], fov: 50`

2. **Lighting System**
   - Ambient light for global illumination
   - Directional light simulating the sun

3. **Controls**
   - Conditional `OrbitControls` for single planet view
   - Custom `RotatingCamera` when orbit controls are disabled

4. **Planet Rendering**
   - Single view: Direct component rendering from `planetComponents` mapping
   - Solar system view: Positioned planets via the `SolarSystem` component

## Conditional UI Elements

The UI adapts based on the current view mode:

1. **Single Planet View**
   - Shows `PlanetSelectorHUD`
   - Displays orbit and rotation controls
   - Shows single planet information panel

2. **Solar System View**
   - Shows zoom target selector panel
   - Displays conditional planet information for selected target
   - Handles dynamic camera movement to selected planets

## Interaction Patterns

1. **View Switching**
   - Buttons to switch between single and solar system views
   - Resets zoom target when switching to solar system view

2. **Planet Selection**
   - In single view: Via the `PlanetSelectorHUD`
   - In solar system view: Via zoom target buttons or direct clicking

3. **Camera Control**
   - Manual control via OrbitControls when enabled
   - Automatic rotation when orbit controls are disabled
   - Automatic positioning in solar system view based on zoom target

4. **Screenshot Functionality**
   - Uses canvas `.toDataURL()` to generate PNG images
   - Dynamic filename based on current view and selected planet

## Animation Systems

1. **Camera Animations**
   - Subtle auto-rotation in single view mode
   - Smooth camera transitions in solar system view using Vector3 lerping

2. **Moon Orbit Animation**
   - Moon orbits around Earth in solar system view
   - Uses `useFrame` to continually update rotation

## Removed Component

The previously implemented Stars component had been providing a starfield background but has been removed. It was using:
- Leva controls for customization
- Shader-based rendering for stars with varied properties
- Custom HUD with ReactDOM.createPortal

## Key Technical Features

1. **Conditional Rendering** - Extensively used for view modes and UI elements
2. **useRef and useFrame** - Used for animations and Three.js references
3. **useEffect** - Used for camera target updates
4. **Vector3 Lerping** - Smooth camera transitions
5. **Advanced Object Configuration** - Planet positions, scales and information

This architecture follows a modular component design that separates concerns effectively with clear boundaries between the 3D scene, UI controls, and state management.
