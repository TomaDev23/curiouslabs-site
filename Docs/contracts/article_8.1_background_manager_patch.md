**LEGIT SPEC TITLE:**
üìÑ `article_8.1_background_manager_patch.md`
üìç Save to: `C:\website_build\Docs\contracts\article_8.1_background_manager_patch.md`

---

### üîí PURPOSE

This contract introduces the **BackgroundManager** component and formalizes the new **multi-zone background protocol** for the `/v4` homepage. It standardizes how background assets are layered, loaded, and triggered across scroll sections.

---

## üß© COMPONENT: `BackgroundManager.jsx`

### üß† ROLE

> Provides a persistent canvas-based background layer for `/v4`, independently rendering dynamic assets such as nebula, gradients, noise, and radial fields, while syncing to scroll position and zone triggers.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è SCHEMA

### üîÅ Zones

Each background section is declared in this schema:

```js
const ZONE_BACKGROUND_MAP = {
  hero: ['stars', 'radial_top_left', 'nebula_ambient', 'light_beams', 'spark_particles', 'noise_fade'],
  mission: ['radial_bottom_right', 'nebula_ambient', 'noise_fade'],
  services: ['nebula_center_glow', 'spark_particles'],
  projects: ['light_grid', 'color_fade_scroll', 'grid_animator'],
  testimonials: ['radial_violet_sheen', 'typing_bots'],
  footer: ['quiet_space_blur'],
}
```

| Mounting         | Renders once, above `<App/>` content            |
| Sync             | Listens to scroll and triggers zone transitions |
| Canvas Control   | Enables `useRef` canvas + gradient draw cycles  |

## üîÅ DEV INTEGRATION

1. `import BackgroundManager from '@/components/system/BackgroundManager'`
2. Mount in `App.jsx` **above router** and below theme providers.
3. Add `useBackgroundZone()` to `/v4` sections to trigger transitions
4. Pass `reducedMotion` prop for accessibility support

---

## üß≠ ROUTE LOCK

Only mounted on:

* `/` ‚Üí `DevV4CosmicPage`
* `/safe` ‚Üí `SafeV4CosmicPage`

Excluded from:

* `/legacy`
* `/docs`
* `/products`

---

## üìç STATUS

* [x] Component Stub Created
* [x] Mounted in App.jsx

## üß† IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

* This is now **the only background system for /v4**
* SpaceCanvas has been migrated from HeroPortal to BackgroundManager
* All background-specific visual effects (beams, particles, etc.) are now rendered by the BackgroundManager
* Light beam effects from HeroPortal migrated to BackgroundManager as the 'light_beams' asset
* Component sections now use `useBackgroundZone` to register with the BackgroundManager
* HeroPortal maintains its own interactive parallax effects while core background is handled by BackgroundManager
* Both `/` and `/safe` routes use the same BackgroundManager, ensuring visual consistency
* Noise overlays must be static images with fallback if WebGL fails
* Performance data is collected and can be monitored in development
* Adjacent zone preloading ensures smooth transitions between sections
* Debug mode provides visual indicators for zone boundaries and asset counts

---

## üîß ACCESSIBILITY FEATURES

* Honors user's `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
* Reduces animation complexity and frequency for users with motion sensitivity
* Simplified visual effects in reduced motion mode
* Faster transitions with less visual complexity
* Maintains essential visual theming while removing potentially triggering animations
