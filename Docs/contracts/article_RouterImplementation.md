# React Router Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of React Router for client-side navigation in the CuriousLabs website.

## Structure

The routing system is structured as follows:

- **main.jsx**: Wraps the App component with `BrowserRouter`
- **App.jsx**: Contains all route definitions using `Routes` and `Route` components
- **Components**: Updated to use React Router's `Link` component instead of anchor tags

## Navigation Components Updated

The following components have been updated to use React Router:

1. **NavBar.jsx**:
   - Added active link styling based on current route
   - Implemented mobile menu toggle functionality
   - Added Products dropdown for both desktop and mobile
   - Includes automatic menu closing when navigating to a new route

2. **Footer.jsx**:
   - Updated all navigation links to use `Link` component

3. **Services.jsx**:
   - Updated product links to use `Link` component

4. **Hero/HeroButtons.jsx**:
   - Updated call-to-action buttons to use `Link` component

## Key Benefits

- **No Page Reloads**: Navigation is now handled client-side without full page refreshes
- **Improved Performance**: Faster navigation between pages
- **State Preservation**: Component state is maintained during navigation
- **Active Link Styling**: Current page is highlighted in the navigation menu
- **Mobile Optimization**: Mobile menu properly closes after navigation

## Mobile Menu Behavior

The mobile menu has been implemented with the following features:

- Toggle button to show/hide menu
- Nested Products dropdown with toggle
- Automatic closing when navigating to a new route
- Visual indication of the active page

## Products Dropdown

The Products dropdown menu has two implementations:

1. **Desktop**: Appears on hover using CSS group hover
2. **Mobile**: Toggles open/closed on click with rotating indicator

## Further Enhancements

Potential future improvements:

- Add page transition animations
- Implement lazy loading for product pages
- Add breadcrumb navigation for nested routes
- Consider implementing a scroll restoration mechanism
