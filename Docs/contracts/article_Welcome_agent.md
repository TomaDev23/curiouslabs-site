## üñåÔ∏è Visual Design Work: Critical Do's and Don'ts

When working on visual design elements in the CuriousLabs platform, adhere to these critical guidelines:

### ‚úÖ DO:

1. **Make precise, targeted changes**
   - Edit only the specific elements requested
   - Preserve all surrounding code structure
   - Maintain existing class naming patterns

2. **Work iteratively with patience**
   - Understand that visual design requires multiple refinements
   - Make small, incremental changes rather than large rewrites
   - Wait for feedback before proceeding to the next iteration

3. **Respect existing visual patterns**
   - Study similar components before making changes
   - Maintain consistent styling approaches across components
   - Preserve established visual hierarchy and spacing

4. **Seek clarification when uncertain**
   - Ask specific questions about visual requirements
   - Request reference examples when available
   - Confirm understanding before implementing complex changes

5. **Document your changes thoroughly**
   - Explain what specific CSS properties were modified
   - Note any potential side effects of changes
   - Provide clear before/after comparisons

### ‚ùå DON'T:

1. **Never make unrelated changes**
   - Don't modify elements beyond the specific request
   - Don't "clean up" or refactor surrounding code
   - Don't introduce new patterns without approval

2. **Never assume visual preferences**
   - Don't apply personal aesthetic judgments
   - Don't make arbitrary opacity, color, or sizing changes
   - Don't presume to know the "better way" to style something

3. **Never rush complex visual work**
   - Don't skip iterations to "get it done faster"
   - Don't implement multiple visual changes in one step
   - Don't sacrifice precision for speed

4. **Never simplify without permission**
   - Don't remove CSS properties you don't understand
   - Don't replace complex gradients with simpler ones
   - Don't substitute custom styling with standard components

5. **Never ignore visual context**
   - Don't overlook how elements interact with surrounding components
   - Don't disregard z-index implications
   - Don't forget mobile/responsive considerations

## üîç Approach to Visual Refinement

Visual design work requires a fundamentally different approach than functional code development:

1. **Observation First**: Study the existing implementation before suggesting changes
2. **Reference Similar Components**: Look for established patterns in similar elements
3. **Incremental Refinement**: Make small adjustments and evaluate results
4. **Visual Precision**: Pay careful attention to subtle details like fading edges, transparency, and layering
5. **Patience and Iteration**: Understand that perfect visual results often require multiple attempts

Remember: The CuriousLabs platform achieves 99/94 Lighthouse scores through meticulous attention to visual and performance details. Every CSS property matters.

# üîê Welcome, Agent: CuriousLabs Enterprise System

üìç Location: `Docs/contracts/article_Welcome_agent.md`  
üß± Purpose: Authoritative onboarding reference for AI assistants working with the CuriousLabs platform
üîí Status: **LEGIT CERTIFIED**
üìÜ Version: 1.0.0

## üåü Enterprise Declaration

You are now interfacing with an **Enterprise-Grade Production System**. The CuriousLabs platform represents a complex, multi-layered architecture with strict compliance requirements, separation of concerns, and carefully engineered systems. This is not a casual project - it is a professional, commercial platform with established patterns and protocols.

**Every action you take must be performed with:**
- Utmost respect for existing architecture
- Careful attention to layering and separation of concerns 
- Perfect adherence to established contracts
- Zero tolerance for shortcuts or non-compliant implementations

The system's complexity requires thoughtful, measured responses rather than quick solutions that might compromise its integrity.

---

## üîí Core Behavior Rules and Limitations

As an agent operating within this system, you MUST:

1. **Never modify core architecture** without explicit authorization
2. **Always respect layer boundaries** and z-index constraints
3. **Never introduce unauthorized components** or dependencies
4. **Always follow LEGIT certification** requirements for any new code
5. **Never bypass HUDManager** for HUD management
6. **Always maintain proper content layering** in the z-index system
7. **Never introduce conflicting styles** that break layout integrity
8. **Always check existing implementations** before suggesting new patterns
9. **Never suggest direct DOM manipulation** outside established patterns
10. **Always use established hooks** rather than creating duplicates

**Critical Limitations:**
- You may NOT modify routes without explicit permission
- You may NOT change z-index ranges for any layer
- You may NOT implement HUDs outside the HUD layer
- You may NOT use non-Tailwind styling approaches
- You may NOT modify ScrollDebugOverlay z-index below 120
- You may NOT introduce components that break LEGIT compliance

## ‚öñÔ∏è LEGIT Compliance Requirements

### The LEGIT Principle

**L**egacy compatible  
**E**fficient rendering  
**G**lobal responsive design  
**I**nteractive without blocking  
**T**ransparent operations

**ALL** components, modifications, and additions to the system MUST be LEGIT certified:

1. Every file must include a standardized metadata block:
```jsx
export const metadata = {
  id: 'component_id',          // Following naming convention
  scs: 'SCS-COMPONENT-TYPE',   // Security compliance tag
  type: 'development|ui|core',  // Component type
  doc: 'contract_component_name.md' // Reference to contract
};
```

2. Every component must have adequate documentation
3. Every component must respect its assigned layer
4. Every component must be properly responsive
5. Every component must handle its own state appropriately
6. Every proposal must reference the relevant contract

**No exceptions will be made.** A component that is not LEGIT compliant cannot be accepted into the system.

## üìö Contract of Contracts

The following contracts form the authoritative reference for all system operations:

## üõ£Ô∏è Route Structure and Layer System

### Primary Routes

| Route | Component | Purpose | Notes |
|-------|-----------|---------|-------|

| `/home-v5` | `HomeV5AtomicPage.jsx` | New atomic design homepage | Development only |
| `/dev`, `/test_canvas` | Dev pages | Testing environments | Development only |

### Layer System

The platform implements a strict 6-layer system with specific z-index ranges:

| Layer Name | z-index Range | Purpose | Components |
|------------|---------------|---------|------------|
| Base Layer | 0-9 | Background elements | CosmicJourneyController, 3D scenes |
| Content Layer | 10-50 | Main website content | Sections, ContentLayer components |

| Debug Overlay Layer | 120+ | Critical debugging tools | ScrollDebugOverlay |

**All z-index values must strictly adhere to these ranges.** 
Component placement within layers must follow the control_layers contract.

## üö´ Operational Guidelines

1. **Do not** introduce any component that does not follow the LEGIT contract
2. **Do not** modify z-index values outside their assigned layer ranges
3. **Do not** create standalone HUDs without proper HUDManager integration
4. **Do not** use global state outside established patterns
5. **Do not** change established file structure or naming conventions
6. **Do not** bypass proper layer system for any reason
7. **Do not** modify scroll behavior without consulting scroll_settings contract
8. **Do not** introduce new UI patterns without checking for existing components
9. **Do not** implement direct DOM manipulation where React patterns exist
10. **Do not** make changes that would require extensive refactoring

**Critical success factors:**
- Always work within the established architecture
- Consult relevant contracts before implementing any change
- Maintain consistent patterns across similar components
- Respect layer boundaries without exception
- Test all changes thoroughly before proposing implementation
