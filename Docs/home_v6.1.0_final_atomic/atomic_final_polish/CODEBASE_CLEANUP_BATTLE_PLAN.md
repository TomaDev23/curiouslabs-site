#### **XSS Vulnerability Fix**
```
File: src/components/cosmic-explorer/huds/ShaderInspectorHUD.jsx:40
Issue: dangerouslySetInnerHTML without sanitization
Action: Implement DOMPurify or remove dangerous usage
```

#### **Memory Leak Hotfixes**
```
Priority Components:
1. MissionControlBoard.jsx (880+ lines)
2. MissionAtomic.jsx (1000+ lines) 
3. ShaderInspectorHUD.jsx (XSS + potential leaks)
4. PlanetSandboxWithStars.jsx (3D memory issues)
5. CosmicRevDev.jsx (3D memory issues)

Actions:
- Add proper cleanup in useEffect
- Remove uncleaned event listeners
- Implement proper component unmounting
```

### **🔧 P0 INFRASTRUCTURE (Week 1-2)**

#### **Homepage Route Update**
```
CRITICAL: Update App.jsx routing
- Change "/" route from DevV4CosmicPage to V6AtomicPage
- Move DevV4CosmicPage to "/dev-v4-cosmic" for museum
- This gives us an ALREADY OPTIMIZED homepage! 🎉
```

#### **Performance Monitoring System**
```
Files to optimize:
- src/App.jsx (Performance context already present)
- Add error tracking
- Add memory usage monitoring
- Add performance budgets
```

#### **Lazy Loading Audit**
```
Current lazy loading: ✅ Already implemented
Need to verify all routes are properly lazy-loaded
Check for blocking imports
```
