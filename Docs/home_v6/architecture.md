# CuriousLabs V6 Implementation Plan for Cursor

Here's a comprehensive plan for implementing the CuriousLabs V6 website in Cursor, structured to maximize efficiency and maintain quality:

## üõ†Ô∏è Initial Setup Phase

### Project Initialization
```bash

```

### Folder Structure Setup in Cursor
```
# Use Cursor to quickly scaffold project structure
src/
‚îú‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ home/
‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ v6/
‚îÇ        ‚îî‚îÄ .gitkeep
‚îú‚îÄ hooks/
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ .gitkeep
‚îú‚îÄ pages/
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ index.js (placeholder)
‚îú‚îÄ styles/
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ globals.css
‚îú‚îÄ utils/
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ .gitkeep
```

## üß© Batched Implementation Strategy

### Batch 1: Core Architecture
Focus on this first as it provides the skeleton for all other components:

1. **Create hooks first:**
   ```
   # Cursor prompt
   Create two hooks: useScrollTrigger.js and useBreakpoint.js according to [copy code specifications]
   ```

2. **Implement LayoutWrapper and NavBarCosmic:**
   ```
   # Cursor prompt
   Implement LayoutWrapper.jsx and NavBarCosmic.jsx as a batch according to the LEGIT protocol [copy component design]
   ```

3. **Implement PillNav:**
   ```
   # Cursor prompt
   Create the PillNav.jsx component with all styling and interactions [copy component design]
   ```

4. **Test the core architecture:**
   - Add a simple placeholder page to verify layout, navigation, and responsive behavior

### Batch 2: Hero Section

1. **Implement HeroPortal:**
   ```
   # Cursor prompt
   Create the HeroPortal.jsx component with responsive layout, animations, and placeholder for cosmic sphere [copy component specs]
   ```

2. **Update index.js to include HeroPortal:**
   ```
   # Cursor prompt
   Update the index.js page to use LayoutWrapper and HeroPortal components
   ```

3. **Test the hero section:**
   - Verify animations, responsive behavior, and layout

### Batch 3: Services Section

1. **Implement ServicesOrbital:**
   ```
   # Cursor prompt
   Create the ServicesOrbital.jsx component with card stack system, pill navigation, and orbital visualizations [copy component specs]
   ```

2. **Update index.js again:**
   ```
   # Cursor prompt
   Update index.js to include ServicesOrbital section
   ```

3. **Test services interaction:**
   - Verify card transitions, service selection, and responsive layouts

### Batch 4: Process Section

1. **Implement ProcessCards:**
   ```
   # Cursor prompt
   Create the ProcessCards.jsx component with numbered steps, orbital connections, and animations [copy component specs]
   ```

2. **Update index.js to include ProcessCards:**
   ```
   # Cursor prompt
   Update index.js to include ProcessCards section
   ```

3. **Test process animation flow:**
   - Verify step animations, connections, and responsive behavior

### Batch 5: Contact Section & Final Integration

1. **Implement ContactTerminal:**
   ```
   # Cursor prompt
   Create the ContactTerminal.jsx component with terminal-inspired form, validation, and cosmic visual [copy component specs]
   ```

2. **Finalize index.js:**
   ```
   # Cursor prompt
   Update index.js to include ContactTerminal and make final adjustments to the page flow
   ```

3. **Comprehensive testing:**
   - Test full page scroll behavior, navigation, and responsive layouts

## üöÄ Cursor-Specific Efficiency Tips

### Context Management
```
# Before each batch, reset the context:
1. Close all files but keep the project open
2. Start a fresh conversation with specific context for the batch
3. Use "I'm implementing the CuriousLabs V6 website. For this batch, I'm focusing on [specific components]"
```

### Code Block Insertion
```
# Be explicit about file paths when requesting implementations:
"Please implement src/components/home/v6/HeroPortal.jsx with the following requirements..."

# When Cursor generates the code, use the "Insert at cursor" button to place it directly in your file
```

### Batch Editing
```
# For similar changes across multiple files:
"I need to update all components to use the new color scheme. Here's the pattern to search and replace:"

# For global adjustments:
"Update all section components to use the same intersection observer pattern as follows:"
```

### Component Testing
```
# After implementing each component, use Cursor to generate quick test cases:
"Generate a test case for the ServicesOrbital component that verifies card transitions work"

# Use these for validation before moving to the next batch
```

## üìä Implementation Timeline

| Batch | Components | Estimated Time | Complexity |
|-------|------------|----------------|------------|
| 1 | Core Architecture | 2-3 hours | High |
| 2 | Hero Section | 1-2 hours | Medium |
| 3 | Services Section | 2-3 hours | High |
| 4 | Process Section | 1-2 hours | Medium |
| 5 | Contact & Final | 2-3 hours | High |

## üß™ Testing Strategy

1. **Component-Level Testing:**
   - After each component implementation, verify it in isolation
   - Use React Developer Tools to inspect props and state

2. **Section Integration Testing:**
   - After each batch, test the section's integration with existing components
   - Verify scroll behavior, animations, and transitions

3. **Responsive Testing:**
   - Use browser dev tools to test different viewport sizes
   - Verify at common breakpoints: 375px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px

4. **Performance Testing:**
   - Use Chrome Lighthouse to identify any performance issues
   - Check animation smoothness and scroll performance

## üí° Asset Integration Strategy

### Starfield Backgrounds
```
# In LayoutWrapper.jsx, add this after initial implementation:
"Update the background layer to dynamically use the provided starfield images:"

# Then provide an asset utility:
"Create a utility function in utils/assets.js to manage the starfield images and provide them to components"
```

### Planet/Celestial Objects
```
# After implementing placeholder planets in ServicesOrbital:
"Replace the planet placeholders with actual assets imported from [your asset source]"
```

## üìù Final Optimization Phase

After all components are implemented:

1. **Code Optimization:**
   ```
   # Cursor prompt
   Review all components and suggest optimizations for performance, focusing on rendering and animations
   ```

2. **Asset Optimization:**
   ```
   # Cursor prompt
   Create an asset preloading strategy for the starfield backgrounds and planet images
   ```

3. **Accessibility Review:**
   ```
   # Cursor prompt
   Review all components for accessibility issues and suggest improvements
   ```

Following this phased, batch-oriented approach will help you maintain focus while implementing the CuriousLabs V6 website in Cursor, ensuring both efficiency and quality.
