I'll provide a comprehensive handover report of the V6 website implementation for CuriousLabs.

# 🚀 CuriousLabs V6 Implementation Handover Report

## 📋 Project Overview
The V6 website implementation follows a tile-based mission plan with performance-first architecture and LEGIT protocol compliance.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

### Device Capability System
- Implemented in `SceneControllerV6`
- Automatically detects:
  - WebGL2/WebGL1 support
  - Canvas capabilities
  - Performance tier (high/medium/low)
- Provides fallback components for low-end devices

### Mission Tracking System
Located in `src/components/home/v6/MissionTracker.jsx`:
```typescript
Interface Structure:
- MissionTask {
  id: string
  title: string
  completed: boolean
  subtasks: Array<{id, title, completed}>
}
```

## 🎯 Implementation Status

### ✅ Tile A (Core Foundation) - COMPLETED
- `SceneControllerV6` with device detection
- Performance tier system
- Mission tracking with localStorage persistence
- Developer mode overlay

### ✅ Tile B (Background System) - COMPLETED
- `GridOverlayV6` - Performance-based grid density
- `StarfieldCanvasV6` - Adaptive star count
- `CosmicBackgroundSystemV6` - Gradient effects
- FPS limiting for low-end devices

### 🔄 Tile C (Hero Elements) - IN PROGRESS
Components implemented:
1. `AegisPlanet3DV6.tsx`
   - Three.js integration
   - Performance-based texture loading
   - Adaptive geometry detail
   - Atmosphere effects

2. `AegisPlanetV6.tsx`
   - Fallback rendering system
   - WebGL capability detection
   - CSS/SVG fallback for low-end devices

3. `HeroSequenceV6.tsx`
   - AnimatePresence transitions
   - Staggered text reveal
   - Adaptive loading states

## 🔧 Key Technical Features

### Performance Optimization
- Automatic quality adjustment based on device capabilities
- Texture quality scaling (2k/1k based on performance tier)
- Geometry detail adaptation
- FPS limiting for low-end devices

```

### State Management
- Uses React Context for:
  - Scene phase management
  - Mission tracking
  - Device capabilities
  - Performance settings

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Current Issues
- Performance concerns on certain devices
- Freezing issues reported
- Need for version downgrade consideration

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Complete remaining Tile C tasks:
   - Finish planet texture loading system
   - Complete text reveal animations
   - Optimize transition timings

2. Performance Improvements:
   - Consider reducing Three.js complexity
   - Implement more aggressive texture compression
   - Add frame rate monitoring

## 🔄 Version Downgrade Considerations

### Suggested Approach
1. Maintain core functionality while reducing complexity:
   - Simplify 3D effects
   - Use more CSS-based animations
   - Implement stricter performance gates

2. Priority Features to Preserve:
   - Device capability detection
   - Mission tracking system
   - Fallback components
   - Core visual identity

### Migration Path
1. Create simplified versions of:
   - Planet visualization (less geometry, simpler materials)
   - Background effects (reduce particle count)
   - Animation system (optimize transition timings)

2. Update performance thresholds:
   - More conservative WebGL usage
   - Earlier fallback triggering
   - Reduced animation complexity

## 📚 Documentation Status
- Implementation guide in `Docs/home_v6/components/v6_MasterPlan_v1.0.md`
- Work plan in `Docs/home_v6/components/v6_work_plan.md`
- Component documentation in respective files

## 🔐 LEGIT Protocol Compliance
All implemented components follow LEGIT protocol with:
- Proper metadata
- Performance considerations
- Accessibility features
- Type definitions
- Error handling
