# V6 ATOMIC HUD Mission Report

## Mission Overview

This report details the implementation of Cursor Missions 1 and 2 for the V6 ATOMIC HUD system, which involved scaffolding the core HUD components, integrating them with the V6 home page, and implementing the Mission Tracker HUD.

## Completed Tasks

### Core Infrastructure

✅ **DraggableHOC Component**
- Implemented a higher-order component for making HUD elements draggable
- Added position persistence using localStorage with v6 prefix
- Implemented error handling and boundary checking

✅ **V6HUDHub Component**
- Created a central control panel for toggling HUD visibility
- Implemented visibility state management with React Context
- Added localStorage persistence for HUD visibility state
- Implemented keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Alt+H) for toggling the HUD Hub

✅ **V6HUDSystem Component**
- Created a main container for all HUD components
- Implemented error boundaries for fault isolation
- Added development-only rendering check
- Created placeholder components for future HUDs

### V6 Home Page Integration

✅ **Section Definitions**
- Defined section data with IDs, names, and positions
- Added position data for future section control functionality

✅ **Scroll Tracking**
- Implemented scroll progress tracking with requestAnimationFrame
- Added state management for scroll position

✅ **Conditional Rendering**
- Added section visibility controls based on HUD settings
- Implemented localStorage persistence for section visibility

### HUD Components

✅ **MissionTrackerHUD**
- Implemented a draggable Mission Tracker component
- Moved mission tracking functionality from fixed overlay to HUD component
- Added toggle functionality for Mission Tracker visibility
- Ensured persistence of Mission Tracker position
- Maintained mission and task progress functionality

### Documentation

✅ **Developer Guide**
- Created comprehensive guide for the V6 ATOMIC HUD system
- Documented components, usage, and integration
- Added troubleshooting section and keyboard shortcuts
- Updated documentation to include Mission Tracker HUD

## Current Limitations

- **Placeholder Components**: Section Control Panel and Scroll Debug are currently placeholders
- **Section Positioning**: Section position control is not yet implemented
- **Section Boundaries**: Visual boundaries for sections are not yet implemented
- **Console API**: No console API for controlling HUDs via browser console

## Next Steps

### Cursor Mission 3: Implement Section Control Panel

1. Create a draggable SectionControlPanel component
2. Implement section visibility toggles
3. Add section position controls
4. Implement localStorage persistence for section positions

### Cursor Mission 4: Implement Scroll Debug

1. Create a draggable ScrollDebugV6 component
2. Implement detailed scroll metrics
3. Add visual indicators for scroll progress
4. Implement phase boundary visualization

### Cursor Mission 5: Implement Section Boundaries

1. Create a SectionBoundaryDebug component
2. Implement visual overlays for section boundaries
3. Add section metrics display
4. Implement hover interactions for boundary visualization

## Integration Verification

The V6 ATOMIC HUD system has been successfully integrated with the V6 home page. The system is:

- **Isolated**: Only available in development mode
- **Non-invasive**: Does not affect the main application
- **Persistent**: State is saved to localStorage
- **Accessible**: Available via keyboard shortcuts
- **Extensible**: Ready for future HUD components

## Conclusion

Cursor Missions 1 and 2 for the V6 ATOMIC HUD system have been successfully completed. The core infrastructure has been implemented, the Mission Tracker has been integrated into the HUD system, and the system is now ready for the next phase of development.
