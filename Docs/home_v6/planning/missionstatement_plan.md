I understand your goal to add an "Our Mission" component over the milkyway image in section 2. Based on the reference images you shared, here's my understanding and implementation plan:

## Understanding of the Design

**First Image (Eclipse-Style Mission Statement)**:
- A dark eclipse/circle design with "our mission" text
- Clean, minimalist aesthetic with high contrast
- Text positioned within the dark circle
- Supporting text describing the mission below the main heading
- Small visual elements and subtle glows around the edges

**Second Image (Numbered Process Steps)**:
- Large, visually prominent numbers (01, 02, 03, 04)
- Alternating left-right-left-right layout
- Each number has an associated heading and descriptive text
- Visual differentiation through typography and spacing
- Content appears to be process/methodology related

## Implementation Plan

1. **Create the Mission Component**:
   - Build a centered eclipse/circle design with the "our mission" text
   - Position it over the milkyway background
   - Ensure proper contrast and visibility against the cosmic background
   - Add supporting mission statement text

2. **Add Numbered Mission Points**:
   - Implement large numbered elements (01, 02, 03) in a Z-pattern layout
   - Alternate between left and right alignment for visual interest
   - Each number will have associated descriptive text
   - Initially static, but structured for future animation

3. **Technical Approach**:
   - Create a new React component called `MissionStatementV6.jsx`
   - Position this within the existing Cosmic Lore Panel section
   - Use absolute positioning with z-index to layer properly over the milkyway image
   - Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes

4. **Visual Style**:
   - Use high contrast (white text on dark eclipse or dark text on light background)
   - Implement subtle glow effects for the eclipse edges
   - Use consistent typography with the rest of the site
   - Ensure visual hierarchy with the main mission statement and supporting points

5. **Future Animation**:
   - Structure the component for future scroll-triggered animations
   - Plan for the mission circle to "unfold" or transition
   - Set up numbered points to appear sequentially as user scrolls
   - Add proper classnames and structure for animation later

## Component Structure

```jsx
// MissionStatementV6.jsx
const MissionStatementV6 = () => {
  return (
    <div className="mission-container">
      {/* Eclipse/Circle with Mission Statement */}
      <div className="mission-eclipse">
        <div className="mission-content">
          <h2>our mission</h2>
          <p>helping artists to achieve their creative and economic sovereignty through technology</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      {/* Numbered Mission Points */}
      <div className="mission-points">
        <div className="mission-point left">
          <div className="number">01</div>
          <div className="content">
            <h3>Research & Analyze</h3>
            <p>Description of first mission point...</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <div className="mission-point right">
          <div className="number">02</div>
          <div className="content">
            <h3>Concept & Sketch</h3>
            <p>Description of second mission point...</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <div className="mission-point left">
          <div className="number">03</div>
          <div className="content">
            <h3>Design & Brand</h3>
            <p>Description of third mission point...</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

This component would then be integrated into your existing `v6_home.jsx` file within the Cosmic Lore Panel section.

Would you like me to proceed with implementing this component based on this understanding?
