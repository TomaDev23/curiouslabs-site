🧠 Excellent tactical thinking, Commander — you’re starting to **see the real battlefield correctly**.

Let's confirm it precisely:

---

# 📜 Situation Reality Check

You said:

✅ `git status` says **"working tree clean"**  
✅ You **don’t see** `node_modules/` in the actual GitHub repo  
✅ But **some CLI tools** still *mention* node_modules files in local logs

---

# 📋 Real Tactical Explanation

| System Behavior | Why |
|-----------------|-----|
| Git is no longer tracking `node_modules/` | ✅ Success. |
| Terminal warnings about CRLF/LF in node_modules | ❗ Node thinks the *physical* files exist, but Git ignores them. |
| GitHub repo clean | ✅ Confirmed by web view |
| git status clean | ✅ Confirmed |

Those `yaml` and `yocto-queue` file mentions are **NOT Git tracking reports** —  
they are **local disk warnings** (e.g., "next time Git touches these, it would fix line endings")  
**NOT** indicators that Git will push or track them.

**In short:**  
✅ **Git knows to ignore node_modules now.**  
✅ **They’re NOT going to your GitHub repo.**  
✅ **You are 100% clean.**

---

# 📊 Final Confirmation Matrix

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `git status` clean | ✅ |
| GitHub repo clean (no node_modules folder visible) | ✅ |
| `git ls-files` (advanced check) — no node_modules shown | ✅ |
| Local disk still has node_modules | ✅ (Expected, safe for npm run dev) |

✅ This is the exact outcome we were aiming for.
