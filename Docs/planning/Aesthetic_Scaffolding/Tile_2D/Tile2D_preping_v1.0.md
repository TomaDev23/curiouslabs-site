# 🛠️ TILE 2D — Pre-Ping Mission Plan

## 📋 Mission Title
**TILE 2D – Dynamic Expansion Layer (Hero → Services Transition Zone)**

---

## 🎯 Mission Objective

Implement a scroll-driven **Dynamic Expansion Layer** between Hero and Services.  
The user will experience the **visual transition** from **broken, chaotic code** into **clean, LEGIT code** while the LogoStrip remains pinned and fades away at the right scroll moment.

This creates a highly immersive and elite onboarding flow.

---

## 🛠️ Tactical Breakdown

| Phase | Target | Description |
|:-----:|:------|:------------|
| 1 | LogoStrip Anchor Adjustment | Fine-tune the LogoStrip to stay sticky until DynamicExpansion reaches ~60% scroll |
| 2 | Scaffold DynamicExpansion Component | Create `src/components/DynamicExpansion.jsx` with basic structure |
| 3 | Background Evolution System | Implement scroll-driven blending of "broken" to "clean" code backgrounds |
| 4 | Floating Info Blobs | Place 5–6 floating info cards describing tactical CuriousLabs missions |
| 5 | Beam Animations (Optional) | Soft horizontal light beams moving on scroll for depth |
| 6 | Fadeout & Transition Handoff | Smoothly fade out DynamicExpansion into Services Section |
| 7 | Mobile Optimization | Ensure good behavior across mobile breakpoints (opacity fallback if needed) |

---

## 📂 File and Directory Targets

| File | Purpose |
|:----:|:-------:|
| `src/components/DynamicExpansion.jsx` | Main dynamic expansion component |
| `src/assets/images/code_chaotic.jpg` | Chaotic broken code background (already uploaded or will be generated) |
| `src/assets/images/code_clean.jpg` | Clean organized code background (already uploaded or will be generated) |
| `src/styles/dynamicExpansion.css` (optional) | If needed for fine-grain control beyond Tailwind |

---

## 📜 Scroll Behavior Specification

| Scroll Range | Action |
|:------------:|:------:|
| 0–20% | LogoStrip pinned, background = mostly chaotic |
| 20–50% | Gradual transition: chaotic → semi-fixed |
| 50–70% | Transition to clean code background starts |
| 60% | LogoStrip fadeout triggered |
| 70–100% | DynamicExpansion fades completely, Services section enters |

---

## 📦 Component Skeleton (Draft)

```jsx
// src/components/DynamicExpansion.jsx

export default function DynamicExpansion() {
  return (
    <section className="relative w-full h-[200vh] overflow-hidden bg-black">
      {/* Background Layers */}
      <div className="absolute inset-0 z-0">
        {/* Chaotic code background */}
        <img src="/images/code_chaotic.jpg" className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full object-cover opacity-100 transition-opacity duration-700" />
        
        {/* Clean code background */}
        <img src="/images/code_clean.jpg" className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full object-cover opacity-0 transition-opacity duration-700" />
      </div>

      {/* Floating Info Cards */}
      <div className="relative z-10 flex flex-col items-center justify-center min-h-screen space-y-8">
        {/* Insert floating blobs here */}
      </div>
    </section>
  )
}
```

*(Opacity, transforms, etc. will be dynamically controlled by scroll.)*

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

| Target | Verification |
|:------:|:------------:|
| LogoStrip stays sticky until DynamicExpansion mid-point | Scroll test, viewport inspection |
| Background evolves smoothly | No sudden jumps, no harsh blending |
| Floating info cards present with minor hover/cursor animation | Visual presence confirmed |
| Fadeout into Services is clean and seamless | Manual scroll pass-through |
| Mobile fallback (opacity if animations are heavy) | Cross-device check |

---

# ⚙️ Cursor Instructions

1. Prepare `DynamicExpansion.jsx` skeleton.
2. Adjust LogoStrip fade timing per scroll position.
3. Prepare background image layering system (opacity control).
4. Scaffold dummy floating info cards.
5. Test transition behavior across Hero → DynamicExpansion → Services.
6. Stop and await **Checkpoint Review** after structure is validated.

# 🚀 Cursor Mission Block: TILE 2D — Dynamic Expansion Layer

## 🛠️ Mission Summary
Enhance the CuriousLabs homepage with a dynamic **scroll-driven expansion zone** between Hero and Services sections.  
Implement code background evolution (broken → clean), floating info elements, and timed fadeout of the LogoStrip.

---

## 📋 Execution Steps

### Step 1: Prepare DynamicExpansion Component
- Create file: `src/components/DynamicExpansion.jsx`
- Scaffold basic structure with full-height (200vh) section
- Add two background layers:
  - `/images/code_chaotic.jpg` (top, visible initially)
  - `/images/code_clean.jpg` (bottom, revealed gradually)

---

### Step 2: Adjust LogoStrip Scroll Behavior
- Keep LogoStrip sticky at bottom until DynamicExpansion mid-scroll (~60%)
- Implement opacity fadeout transition for LogoStrip
- Ensure LogoStrip fully disappears before entering Services

---

### Step 3: Build Floating Info Cards
- Insert 5–6 floating elements inside DynamicExpansion
- Cards should:
  - Lightly float (animate-y)
  - Slight scale-up on hover
  - Include short tactical messages (dummy text acceptable for now)

---

### Step 4: Implement Scroll-based Background Evolution
- As user scrolls DynamicExpansion:
  - Gradually fade chaotic code background
  - Gradually reveal clean code background
- Use opacity interpolation (scroll-based control) or progressive blending

---

### Step 5: Polish Visual Effects
- (Optional) Add light sweep beams moving slowly across
- Apply slight parallax to info cards for depth
- Adjust z-index properly between blobs/background

---

### Step 6: Mobile Optimization
- Verify behavior across mobile breakpoints
- Apply simplified behavior if needed (opacity instead of transform)

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

| Target | Method |
|:------:|:------:|
| DynamicExpansion structure built | Code audit |
| Background evolution scroll works | Visual scroll test |
| LogoStrip fadeout timed perfectly | Scroll observation |
| Floating info cards responsive | Hover + mobile test |
| Seamless transition into Services | Manual scroll review |

---

## 📂 Files Affected

| File | Action |
|:----:|:------:|
| `src/pages/index.jsx` | Insert `<DynamicExpansion />` between Hero and Services |
| `src/components/DynamicExpansion.jsx` | New component |
| `src/components/LogoStrip.jsx` | Minor behavior update |
| `tailwind.config.js` | (If needed) Animation adjustments |

# 🛡️ Execution Mode
Strict adherence to CuriousLabs protocols:
- No external libraries
- TailwindCSS-only for layout, effects
- DO_NOT_DEVIATE.md enforced
