‚úÖ Confirmed, Commander.  
**Your review is correct.**  
The LogoStrip behavior is *still not correctly pinned to the bottom* and *fades out too early*, wrecking the early DynamicExpansion experience.

---

# üõ† Root Cause Summary
From your full war gallery + audit:
- The LogoStrip sticky **sticks only to Hero** ‚Äî it **detaches** when DynamicExpansion scrolls.
- There is **no continuous "floor"** logic across Hero ‚Üí DynamicExpansion.
- Fade-out is triggered **relative to DynamicExpansion progress**, but **positioning is wrong** ‚Äî it's trying to stick to the Hero box height, not viewport bottom.
- Result: you get this weird visual where **it disappears into black space instead of evolving smoothly into the next scene**.

---
  
# üß† Corrected Understanding (Battleplan)

**We must treat Hero + DynamicExpansion together as a single pinned "stage"**, like this:

```
|----------------------|
| HERO                 |
| (fixed, scrolls)     |
|                      |
|----------------------| <- viewport bottom, LogoStrip pinned here
| DYNAMIC EXPANSION    |
| (fixed, scrolls)     |
|                      |
|----------------------|
```

Meaning:
- LogoStrip must stay pinned to the viewport **across both Hero + early DynamicExpansion**.
- Only after DynamicExpansion is passed (~60-70%), LogoStrip fades and gives control to the normal Services section.

---

# ü™ñ Full Correction Strategy

### 1. Merge Hero and DynamicExpansion under a new container:

```jsx
<div className="relative min-h-[300vh] overflow-hidden">
  {/* Hero Section */}
  <Hero />

  {/* Dynamic Expansion Section */}
  <DynamicExpansion scrollProgress={dynamicExpansionProgress} />

  {/* LogoStrip pinned to bottom */}
  <div className="sticky bottom-0 w-full z-30 transition-all duration-700"
       style={{
         opacity: logoStripOpacity,
         transform: `translateY(${Math.min(20, scrollY * 0.05)}px)`,
         willChange: 'opacity, transform'
       }}>
    <LogoStrip />
  </div>
</div>
```

**‚ö° Big Change:**  
Hero and DynamicExpansion are part of *one scroll-controlled world*.  
Not separately stacking and losing sticky context.

---

### 2. Adjust DynamicExpansion height
- Current is `200vh` ‚Äî maybe bump to `250vh` or `300vh`
- Smooth scroll needed before passing to Services

---

### 3. Correct Scroll Tracking
- **DynamicExpansion progress** should include offset for Hero height
- So fading of LogoStrip is tied to scroll *over both Hero + DynamicExpansion*, not just DynamicExpansion.

---

### 4. LogoStrip behavior redefined:
- Fully visible: until ~50% of DynamicExpansion
- Smooth fading: 50%-70%
- Fully gone: after 70%
- (All relative to combined scroll height of Hero + DynamicExpansion.)

# üõ† Final Correction Plan for TILE 2D.3

## 1. Structure Hero + DynamicExpansion into one unified scroll block
- New container:  
  ```jsx
  <div className="relative min-h-[300vh] overflow-hidden">
    <Hero />
    <DynamicExpansion scrollProgress={dynamicExpansionProgress} />
    <LogoStrip /> {/* pinned sticky bottom */}
  </div>
  ```

- `min-h-[300vh]` ‚Äî might adjust slightly after review depending on scroll feel.

---

## 2. True Sticky LogoStrip
- `sticky bottom-0 w-full z-30`
- Style:
  ```jsx
  style={{
    opacity: logoStripOpacity,
    transform: `translateY(${Math.min(20, scrollY * 0.05)}px)`,
    willChange: 'opacity, transform'
  }}
  ```

---

## 3. Refactor Scroll Calculations
- `scrollY` to track **full Hero + DynamicExpansion progress** 
- Adjust LogoStrip fade formula based on **full unified block**:

```javascript
const logoStripOpacity = Math.max(0, 1 - ((scrollY - viewportHeight * 0.5) / (viewportHeight * 0.8)));
```

**Meaning:**  
- Fade starts ~50% through DynamicExpansion scroll
- Fully invisible ~70‚Äì75%

---

## 4. Visual Checks to Validate
‚úÖ Hero scrolls independently  
‚úÖ LogoStrip pinned through Hero + DynamicExpansion  
‚úÖ Fade starts only deep inside DynamicExpansion  
‚úÖ Fade completes right before Services handoff  
‚úÖ No random jumping, no unpinned LogoStrip

---

# üßπ Mini-Polish (after core merge)

Once structure is solid, very light touches:
- Smooth background blend between Hero and DynamicExpansion
- Make sure z-index layering still clean
- Confirm mobile responsiveness still stable

# TILE 2D.3 - Full Stage Merge Plan

After reviewing the additional documentation and current implementation, I can see we need a more comprehensive approach. The current implementation still doesn't achieve the proper LogoStrip behavior because:

1. LogoStrip is only sticky within the Hero container
2. It loses its sticky behavior once DynamicExpansion starts scrolling
3. The fade timing calculations are correct but the positioning context is wrong

## Correction Strategy (TILE 2D.3)

### 1. Restructure Hero + DynamicExpansion as a Unified Stage
I'll implement a full stage merge approach as outlined in the documentation:

```jsx
<div className="relative min-h-[300vh] overflow-hidden">
  {/* Hero Section */}
  <Hero />

  {/* Dynamic Expansion Section */}
  <DynamicExpansion scrollProgress={dynamicExpansionProgress} />

  {/* LogoStrip pinned to bottom */}
  <div className="sticky bottom-0 w-full z-30 transition-all duration-700"
       style={{
         opacity: logoStripOpacity,
         transform: `translateY(${Math.min(20, scrollY * 0.05)}px)`,
         willChange: 'opacity, transform'
       }}>
    <LogoStrip />
  </div>
</div>
```

### 2. Adjust Scroll Calculations
Modify the scroll calculations to work correctly with the unified stage:

```javascript
// LogoStrip starts fading ~50% through DynamicExpansion, disappears ~70-75%
const logoStripOpacity = Math.max(0, 1 - ((scrollY - viewportHeight * 0.5) / (viewportHeight * 0.8)));

// DynamicExpansion progress now considers full Hero + DynamicExpansion stage
const dynamicExpansionProgress = Math.min(1, Math.max(0, 
  (scrollY - viewportHeight) / (viewportHeight * 2)
));
```

### 3. Ensure Proper Z-index Layering
- Increase LogoStrip z-index to 30 (currently 20) to ensure it stays on top
- Make sure background elements have proper z-index values for layering

### 4. Implementation Steps

1. **Create unified container** that contains Hero, DynamicExpansion, and LogoStrip
2. **Adjust heights** - Set container to min-h-[300vh] for proper scroll space
3. **Update scroll calculations** for LogoStrip opacity and DynamicExpansion progress
4. **Ensure z-index layering** is correct for all elements
5. **Test scroll behavior** - Verify LogoStrip stays fixed at bottom through Hero and early DynamicExpansion scrolling

### 5. Validation Points
- ‚úÖ LogoStrip remains fixed to viewport bottom during Hero scroll
- ‚úÖ LogoStrip stays fixed while scrolling into DynamicExpansion
- ‚úÖ LogoStrip starts fading at ~50% of DynamicExpansion scroll
- ‚úÖ LogoStrip is completely faded by ~70-75% of scroll
- ‚úÖ No jumping or visual glitches during scroll

Would you like me to proceed with implementing this TILE 2D.3 Full Stage Merge strategy?
