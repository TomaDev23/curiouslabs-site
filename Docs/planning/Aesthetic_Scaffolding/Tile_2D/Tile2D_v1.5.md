🧠 Copy that — understood completely, Commander.  
Thanks for the reset heads-up — I'll treat this next move **as final stabilization** for deployment prep.

Here's the tailored plan for the *current reverted state* you posted (matches the screenshots):

---

# 🚀 FINAL TILE 2D.5+ Plan — Corrected for Your Current Build State

## 🎯 Updated Mission Objective
- Stabilize LogoStrip so it **pins cleanly** through:
  - Hero
  - DynamicExpansion
  - Services
- LogoStrip **only fades AFTER** Services ends.
- Remove fake vh heights **while keeping natural flow**.
- Prepare for **LIVE deployment** (no future backtracking).

---

# 🛠 Final Implementation Steps

## 1. Hero Section (✅ keep)

Already fine:
```jsx
<div className="min-h-screen">
  <div className="pt-16 pb-24">
    <Hero />
  </div>
</div>
```
- Fills first screen.

---

## 2. DynamicExpansion Section (✅ keep)

Already good:
```jsx
<div className="relative min-h-[200vh]">
  <DynamicExpansion scrollProgress={dynamicExpansionProgress} />
</div>
```
- 2x screen scroll for code transition.

---

## 3. Services Section (⚡ correction)

👉 Remove any fake `min-h-[150vh]`.  
Replace with **natural size**:

```jsx
<div className="relative" id="services">
  <ScrollReveal animation="fade-in-up" delay="0.1s">
    <Services />
  </ScrollReveal>
</div>
```
- Now the Services section will grow based on real content.
- No empty scroll gaps.

---

## 4. LogoStrip (Sticky and Fade Timing)

Keep structure, adjust opacity formula:

```jsx
<div 
  className="sticky bottom-0 w-full z-30 transition-all duration-700"
  style={{
    opacity: logoStripOpacity,
    transform: `translateY(${Math.min(20, scrollY * 0.05)}px)`,
    willChange: 'opacity, transform'
  }}
>
  <LogoStrip />
</div>
```

Updated opacity logic:

```javascript
const logoStripOpacity = Math.max(0, 1 - ((scrollY - viewportHeight * 4) / (viewportHeight * 0.8)));
```

- Meaning:
  - Hero (0-1vh)
  - DynamicExpansion (1-3vh)
  - Services (~3-4vh based on content size)
  - LogoStrip **only fades** after Services.
  
---

## 5. Scroll Progress (✅ no changes)

Still use:
```javascript
const dynamicExpansionProgress = Math.min(1, Math.max(0, 
  (scrollY - viewportHeight) / (viewportHeight * 2)
));
```
- No edits needed here.

💥 **LOCKING FINAL MOVES. Here’s the official TILE 2D.5 Cursor Action Plan:**  

---

# 🛠 CURSOR EXECUTION — TILE 2D.5 FINAL STABILIZATION PLAN

---

## 1. **Restructure Services Section**
- **File:** `src/pages/index.jsx`
- **Action:**  
  Replace the current Services block with **natural height** structure:
```jsx
<div className="relative" id="services">
  <ScrollReveal animation="fade-in-up" delay="0.1s">
    <Services />
  </ScrollReveal>
</div>
```
✅ **No `min-h-[150vh]` or any forced height here.**

---

## 2. **LogoStrip Sticky + Fade Timing**
- **File:** `src/pages/index.jsx`
- **Action:**  
  Keep the LogoStrip container:
```jsx
<div 
  className="sticky bottom-0 w-full z-30 transition-all duration-700"
  style={{
    opacity: logoStripOpacity,
    transform: `translateY(${Math.min(20, scrollY * 0.05)}px)`,
    willChange: 'opacity, transform'
  }}
>
  <LogoStrip />
</div>
```
✅ Sticky at bottom. ✅ Smooth transform. ✅ Good transition timing.

---

## 3. **Update Opacity Formula**
- **File:** `src/pages/index.jsx`
- **Action:**  
  Update the LogoStrip opacity calculation:
```javascript
const logoStripOpacity = Math.max(0, 1 - ((scrollY - viewportHeight * 4) / (viewportHeight * 0.8)));
```
✅ Fades only after Hero + DynamicExpansion + Services combined.

---

## 4. **No Changes to DynamicExpansion Progress**
- **File:** `src/pages/index.jsx`
- **Action:**  
  **Leave** `dynamicExpansionProgress` as-is:
```javascript
const dynamicExpansionProgress = Math.min(1, Math.max(0, 
  (scrollY - viewportHeight) / (viewportHeight * 2)
));
```
✅ Already tuned.

---

## 5. **Optional: Clean Up Unnecessary Heights**
- **Action:**  
  If any other section (Metrics, CaseStudies, Testimonials) has forced `min-h`, **remove** unless truly needed.
- Let content grow naturally.

---

# 🎯 FINAL SUCCESS CRITERIA
| Checkpoint | Expected Behavior |
|:----------:|:------------------|
| 1 | LogoStrip pinned bottom through Hero |
| 2 | LogoStrip pinned through DynamicExpansion |
| 3 | LogoStrip pinned through Services |
| 4 | LogoStrip starts fading AFTER Services |
| 5 | Natural smooth scroll, no dead space |
| 6 | Site ready for first production deploy |
