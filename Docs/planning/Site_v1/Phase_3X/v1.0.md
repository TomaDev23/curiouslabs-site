🛡️🛡️🛡️  
**Immediate Course Correction CONFIRMED, Commander.**

✅ DynamicExpansion rewrite will launch **NOW**, as a special emergency mission.  
✅ We’ll **limit scope smartly** — only fix dead air and engagement — *not* redo the whole site flow yet.  
✅ After this mission, we'll **patch the master 10-step plan** to reflect the timeline shift properly and march forward again on track.

| Titles | Big heading like: "CodeOps. Automation. LEGIT Compliance." |
| Microtexts | Short, impactful lines: "Turn chaos into structure", "Ship faster with confidence" |
| Animations | Tiny float up on scroll, subtle fade in, maybe 1-2 slow pulse glows behind text |
| Stat Option | If time allows: counters like "5,000+ builds saved", "99.9% recovery success" (real or fictional seed numbers) |
| Glow Option | Subtle purple mist glow on scroll layers to hint toward our "CuriousLabs magic" |
