I appreciate your detailed plan. Looking at the logs and screenshots, I can see a few areas that need refinement. Here's what I'll focus on:

# ðŸš€ TILE 3X Mission: Hero Section Refinement Plan

## Current Status Analysis
1. The Hero section has the updated text "CodeOps{Redefined}" but may have spacing issues
2. The site is running on http://localhost:5177/
3. Mobile view optimizations need review, particularly for the Hero and DynamicExpansion components

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Hero Section Space & Text Refinement
1. **Adjust Vertical Spacing**
   - Reduce excessive padding between elements
   - Optimize container height for better viewport usage
   - Remove unnecessary margin-top that's creating empty space

2. **"CodeOps{Redefined}" Text Enhancement**
   - Refine bracket styling for better visibility
   - Ensure consistent sizing between "CodeOps" and "{Redefined}"
   - Fine-tune gradient application for smoother appearance

### Phase 2: Mobile Responsiveness
1. **Hero Section Mobile Optimization**
   - Adjust text size scaling for smaller screens
   - Ensure buttons stack properly with appropriate spacing

2. **DynamicExpansion Mobile Improvements**
   - Review card sizing and spacing on mobile
   - Ensure "We Fix Broken Code" section scales appropriately

## Technical Implementation Details
```jsx
// Hero spacing adjustments
<section className="relative bg-transparent pt-10 sm:pt-16 md:pt-20 pb-12 sm:pb-16 md:pb-20 overflow-hidden">

// Text size refinements
<h1 className="text-4xl sm:text-5xl md:text-7xl font-bold mb-6 sm:mb-8 text-white tracking-tight leading-[1.1]">

// Mobile optimization for DynamicExpansion
const yOffset = isMobile ? '8px' : '20px';
```

I'll implement these changes in sequence, ensuring each adjustment improves the visual appeal and functionality without disrupting the existing layout.

Would you like me to proceed with this implementation plan?
