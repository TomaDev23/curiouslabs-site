🫡 Confirmed, Commander.

You have **successfully deployed Phase 2**, built all components, and maintained **full tactical integrity**.

Now —  
let’s **correctly task Cursor** to set up a **local server** so you can **preview the full CuriousLabs landing page** on your browser, exactly like you requested (like the MoonSignal dashboard setup).

# 🛠️ Updated Mission for Cursor: Local Server Launch Order

Here’s the precise task to issue:

---

```plaintext
🖥️ Operator Task: Local Preview Server Setup for CuriousLabs

Mission Brief:
The CuriousLabs landing page is now fully built inside Cursor.

You must now configure a local server so the full site can be previewed live in browser, like we did for the MoonSignal dashboard.

Deployment Instructions:

1. **If possible**, prefer Vite (fastest) or CRA (Create React App) for server:
    - If Vite setup detected: 
      ```bash
      npm install
      npm run dev
      ```
    - If no Vite and CRA installed:
      ```bash
      npm install
      npm start
      ```

2. **If no React dev server exists yet:**
    - Initialize a basic Vite React app around `src/`:
      ```bash
      npm create vite@latest curiouslabs-site -- --template react
      ```
    - Copy over `src/`, `public/`, `tailwind.config.js`, etc.

3. **Alternative option:**  
If minimal backend preview needed (basic Flask serve like MoonSignal):
    - Create a lightweight Flask server:
      ```python
      from flask import Flask, send_from_directory
      app = Flask(__name__, static_folder='dist')

      @app.route('/')
      def serve():
          return send_from_directory(app.static_folder, 'index.html')

      if __name__ == "__main__":
          app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=3000, debug=True)
      ```
    - Build the frontend first (`npm run build`) to output `/dist`
    - Serve `/dist` with Flask

**Summary:**
- Goal: Preview full CuriousLabs page in browser (`localhost:3000` or `5173`)
- Solution Path: Prefer Vite or CRA; fallback to Flask + static serve if needed
- Deployment must be live, responsive, navigable

Confirm receipt, begin server setup, and report server address once operational.

# 🔥 Mission Notes

- We prefer **Vite + npm run dev** — simplest and fastest if Cursor has control.
- **Flask serve** is backup if no direct React dev server possible yet.
- **Goal is browser-based live testing**, not static previews inside Cursor panel.

---

# ✅ Tactical Next Step

Issue the above order to Cursor exactly.  
When Cursor sets up the server, you’ll visit:

```
http://localhost:3000
```
or
```
http://localhost:5173
```
and see the full CuriousLabs site live.

# 🚀 Local Server Deployment Launch Block — CuriousLabs Landing Page

**Operator Instruction Set:**  
(Ready for Cursor, terminal, or manual execution)

---

## 📦 Step 1: Check for Existing Project Setup

```powershell
if (Test-Path "package.json") {
    Write-Host "✅ package.json detected. Checking for existing setup..."
    $scripts = (Get-Content "package.json" | ConvertFrom-Json).scripts
    $scripts
} else {
    Write-Host "⚠️ No package.json found. Preparing to initialize Vite project..."
}
```

✅ **Outcome:** Know if you can `npm run dev` or need to create a new setup.

---

## 📦 Step 2A: If package.json Exists — Install and Run

```powershell
npm install
```
Then:
```powershell
npm run dev
```
✅ Server should start on `http://localhost:5173` or `http://localhost:3000`

---

## 📦 Step 2B: If No package.json — Initialize Vite Project

```powershell
npm create vite@latest . -- --template react
```
When prompted:
- **Name:** `curiouslabs-site`
- **Framework:** `React`
- **Variant:** `JavaScript` (no TypeScript unless specified)

✅ Then:

```powershell
npm install
```

---

## 📦 Step 3: Tailwind Setup (if needed)

```powershell
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Then update `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

✅ Update `src/index.css` or your main CSS file to include:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

---

## 📦 Step 4: Start the Dev Server

```powershell
npm run dev
```

✅ Open Browser to:  
`http://localhost:5173`  
or  
`http://localhost:3000`

---

## 📦 Step 5: (Fallback Option) Build and Serve via Flask

If npm dev fails or if preferred:

### Build React app:

```powershell
npm run build
```

This creates a `/dist/` folder.

---

### Create a simple Flask server:

```python
# server.py

from flask import Flask, send_from_directory
app = Flask(__name__, static_folder='dist')

@app.route('/')
def serve():
    return send_from_directory(app.static_folder, 'index.html')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=3000, debug=True)
```

Install Flask if needed:

```bash
pip install flask
```

Run the Flask server:

```bash
python server.py
```

✅ Open Browser to:  
`http://localhost:3000`

---

# ✅ Success Criteria for this Deployment Phase

- [ ] Local server started successfully
- [ ] CuriousLabs landing page visible and interactive
- [ ] All components rendered (Hero → Services → Metrics → CaseStudies → Testimonials)
- [ ] Responsive behavior confirmed (Desktop + Mobile widths)
