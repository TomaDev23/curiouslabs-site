‚úÖ Plan acknowledged and approved, Captain.

We're officially greenlighting:

---

# üöÄ TILE 4.12A ‚Äì Hero Solar Orbit Extension (Homepage Mini Universe)

### üåå Objective
Inject a **second solar system** below the hero section of the homepage, styled as a **cinematic mini-universe**. This universe will visually preview the full product orbit‚Äîbut without titles or text overlays, focusing purely on **motion, icons, and thematic style**.

---

## üì¶ Content Rules

- Keep current **hero + button layout untouched**
- Inject this solar system **after hero, before Our Creations**
- **No card text or labels** ‚Äî icons only (compact orbit)
- Introduce **new orbiting items**:
  - Existing: Aegis, OpsPipe, Curious, Guardian, MoonSignal
  - New orbitals: SaaS, WhiteLabel, AI Edge, Labs
- **Aegis is bottom-center**, acting as the orbit anchor
- Left-heavy bias: whole galaxy pulls in subtly from the left
- Animate on scroll: **fade+scale in when hero exits viewport**
- Color grading: consistent with `/products` cosmic visual style
- Do not break layout or routing ‚Äî same DOM-based, responsive approach
- Reuse `SolarSystemLayout.jsx` logic in compact mode or clone it as `MiniSystemLayout.jsx`

---

## ‚úÖ GO / DO NOT

**DO:**
- Use `framer-motion`, Tailwind, responsive rules
- Allow mobile fallback (can disable orbit)
- Add unique glow around Aegis for this section
- Make this background slightly darker than hero for depth

**DO NOT:**
- Add labels, tooltips, or hover cards
- Introduce routes or new nav logic
- Interfere with first load hero animations
- Break mobile performance or Core Web Vitals

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Execution Suggestion

- Place the component in `src/components/MiniSystemLayout.jsx`
- Trigger entry using `whileInView` or `scrollY` from `framer-motion`
- Apply different radius values to compact the orbit
- Reuse orbiting logic, but lower resolution (smaller card sizes)

---

üß† This is the prequel shot to the `/products` full page. It creates subconscious cohesion, connects Aegis to everything else, and sets the tone.

Let me know when to brief Cursor or issue TILE 4.12A execution block.
