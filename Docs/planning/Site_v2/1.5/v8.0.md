Perfect, Captain. You're now at the cinematic frontier. Based on the current working structure and your directive, here's the next TILE to execute:

---

# 🎬 TILE 4.12D – Cinematic Scroll Trigger & Stellar Entry Sequence

## 🎯 Objective
Trigger a smooth, **scroll-initiated transition** from the **static Hero** into a **full-screen cosmic takeover**, followed by the **animated formation of your branded solar system** — using logos only (no text), in the style of `/products`.

---

## 🧠 Behavior Blueprint

### Phase 1: Scroll Triggered Activation
- 👆 First scroll interaction triggers the sequence (mouse/touch)
- ✨ Hero fades out and lifts gently
- 🌌 Fullscreen starfield + nebula scene fades in underneath

### Phase 2: Cosmic Takeover
- 🌠 Stars expand to fill entire viewport
- 🌀 Nebula effects intensify behind dark gradient
- 🧠 Aegis (large center) + branded logos fly in using framer-motion, like orbit formation

### Phase 3: Orbital Formation
- 🪐 Logos glide into elliptical orbits (like `/products`)
- 🎯 Aegis is central, large
- 🛰️ Others form partial orbit: Curious, Guardian, OpsPipe, MoonSignal
- ⚙️ Optional: Add 1-2 placeholders for “White Label”, “SaaS Engine” to complete the ring

## 🛠️ Component Layout

### `src/components/HeroMain.jsx`
- Wrap existing content in `motion.div`
- Animate out with:
  ```jsx
  opacity: [1, 0], y: [0, -100], scale: [1, 0.95]
  ```

### `src/components/UniverseScrollController.jsx`
- Detect initial scroll (scrollY > 30)
- Lock to `hasScrolledOnce` state (one-time transition trigger)
- Add framer variants for:
  - `heroFadeOut`
  - `universeFadeIn`
  - `systemReveal`

### `src/components/LogoSystemLayout.jsx` (NEW)
- Just logos — no descriptions
- Orbit layout mimics `/products`, with custom size & radius
- Animate in:
  ```jsx
  initial: { opacity: 0, x: 0, y: 0 }
  animate: {
    opacity: 1,
    x: `calc(50% + ${x}px - 50px)`,
    y: `calc(50% + ${y}px - 50px)`
  }
  transition: { delay, type: "spring", stiffness: 50 }
  ```

### Assets:
- Reuse `/public/images/stars-layer-1.svg` and background nebula gradients
- Add `<Comet />` streaks or subtle glows only after system is fully formed

---

## 🧪 Scroll Logic (Inside Controller)
```jsx
const [hasScrolledOnce, setHasScrolledOnce] = useState(false);
useEffect(() => {
  const handleScroll = () => {
    if (window.scrollY > 30 && !hasScrolledOnce) setHasScrolledOnce(true);
  };
  window.addEventListener("scroll", handleScroll);
  return () => window.removeEventListener("scroll", handleScroll);
}, []);
```

Use `hasScrolledOnce` to trigger animations conditionally with `animate={hasScrolledOnce ? "active" : "initial"}`.

---

## 🌌 Optional Visual FX Enhancements

- 🟣 **Glow dust field** using `blur-sm` radial gradients with slow opacity pulse
- 🟠 **Central glow ring** behind Aegis (use orange radial with pulsing opacity)
- 🛰️ **Satellite shimmer**: make one or two logos twinkle gently (pulse shadow)

---

## 🧼 Rules
- ✅ Must use Tailwind + Framer Motion only
- ✅ DOM-based animation only (no Lottie or Canvas)
- ✅ Use reduced motion fallback via `prefers-reduced-motion`
- ✅ Maintain mobile fallback — skip animation entirely for screens `<1024px`

---

## 📍 Outcome

This sequence will turn your Hero section from a static billboard into an **interactive launchpad** — fading into the void and revealing your **branded orbital system** as a live, cinematic visual identity. This is **your moment of lift-off**.

Confirm when ready and I’ll formalize this into the **Cursor Task Block** to begin execution. Ready to orbit? 🛸
