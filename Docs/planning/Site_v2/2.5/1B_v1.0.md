💥 **FULL TILE DEPLOYMENT: PHASE 1B MISSION — `/CODELAB` CONTENT FINALIZATION**  
🎯 Target: CuriousLabs `/codelab` page  
🔍 Objective: Deepen and replace shallow copy **with elite voice**, tactical realism, and light humor where needed.  
🔒 All routing, structure, and visuals are preserved. Cursor must only edit visible `/codelab` blocks — nothing else.

### 💬 SECTION 5: Testimonials (Stubbed with Humor & Meta-Awareness)

**Replace both testimonials with:**

2. `"He rewrote our whole architecture... and gave us personalities. – Claude & CGPT"`  
3. *(Small caption under or between):*  
   _“Real testimonials from human clients coming soon. For now, just ask our agents.”_

## 🧩 Cursor Instructions

1. **Do not alter layout or styling.**

3. **Component bindings must remain untouched.**  
4. **No Tailwind class edits. No props rewire. No logic change.**
