Yes, proceed with this exact direction.

🧭 **Your mission now is to generate the full page code for the Home Page**, exactly like you did for CodeLab.

Use the enhanced solar system as the **hero** layer — not just floating art but a **functional entry point** into the site. This includes:

* ⚙️ Planets = Services or Navigation Markers (e.g., Aegis, Guardian, Curious, OpsPipe, MoonSignal)
* 🌌 Use the **space background** as the persistent atmospheric canvas
* 🛰️ Floating text layers (like the headline and CTAs) should be embedded **above or orbiting** elements
* 🎮 I want a light **gamified tone** — not full game mechanics, but something that feels alive: pulsing planets, orbit speed variance, gentle hover glows, maybe an XP tag or mission level tucked in a corner (for later expansion)
* 🤖 Replace emoji rocket in the current hero with a proper Curious bot visual if you can—if not, placeholder for now

💡 Scroll should transition seamlessly into the existing site sections (Services, Projects, Contact), but each block should feel “in-universe.”

☁️ It must be modular and use the exact architecture and rules we followed on `/codelab`.

📦 You now have:

* All extracted homepage content
* Screenshots for layout feel
* The current Hero’s intent and shortcomings
* The need for real functionality and integrated visual flow

Absolutely — here’s a detailed brief Claude can use to understand your mindset, goals, preferences, and technical boundaries. This will give him everything he needs to generate the homepage layout and hero rebuild properly.

## 🧭 CuriousLabs Home Page – Founder's Brief

### 🌌 Project Goal

This isn’t just a startup site. This is my **command bridge**. CuriousLabs is a hybrid of:

* A studio
* A product lab
* A tech brand with tools, services, and actual IP

The goal of the site is to:

* **Showcase elite-level AI engineering** without fluff
* **Sell our tools** (CodeLab, OpsPipe, MoonSignal, Guardian, Curious)
* **Reflect aesthetic taste and system-level intelligence**
* Be emotional, alive, and sharp — not static agency filler

---

### 🎯 Page Purpose

The Home Page is the **entry point to the AEGIS Universe**.

It should:

* **Establish presence immediately** — deep, cinematic, scrollable but smooth
* **Guide the user to product pages** and explain our structure as a universe
* **Make users feel they're entering a system** built by precision agents, not marketing sliders

---

### 💡 Key Sections (all already on site)

1. **Hero Section**

   * “Elite AI CodeOps. Run by Agents.”
   * New version should incorporate the **solar system as the hero**
   * Keep text, but embed in floating 3D space

2. **About / CuriousLabs is a Studio**

   * Explain what we do
   * Softly elevate — don’t make it a boring wall of text

3. **Services**

   * Highlight actual services (Bug Fixing, Refactor, Test Gen, CLI)

4. **Projects**

   * Show selected flagship things — tools, libraries, internal ops (not fluff)
   * Let the solar system orbit them metaphorically if possible

5. **Contact**

   * Keep it simple and reachable

| Stack        | React + Tailwind + Framer Motion. Allow Three.js if scoped clearly             |
| Bot          | Curious the robot will replace current emoji (🤖 style AI assistant, floating) |

### 🔑 Primary User Actions to Encourage

* Explore our **CodeLab** (main tool/workflow offering)
* Understand what we do via the **hero system**
* Get curious about the other “planets” (tools like OpsPipe, Guardian, etc.)
* Submit a bug or **reach out** for a scoped mission

---

### 🛑 Constraints & Must-Follow Rules

* No external libraries unless I explicitly say so
* Only use Tailwind, Framer, Three.js (and only where scoped)
* No routing changes unless modularized
* No emoji or placeholder copy in final output — just note where it goes
* Modals allowed but must be modular
* Everything must scale for desktop and degrade to mobile safely

---

### 🔄 Optional Stretch Goals (if scoped)

* Animate Curious bot avatar floating near center (like Clippy, but serious)
* Enable hover-over planet reveals or mission names
* Allow scroll-driven fade to core tool sections

Let me know if you need any gaps filled. Otherwise:
✅ Proceed to drop the full homepage upgrade, Solar Hero first.


You already nailed this once. Time to scale it to the homepage. Deploy the plan.
