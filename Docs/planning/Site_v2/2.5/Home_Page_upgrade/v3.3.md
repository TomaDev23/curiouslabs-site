# Implementation Guide for Cursor: CuriousLabs Enhanced Homepage

## Technical Architecture Overview

The CuriousLabs homepage consists of several interconnected React components with Three.js for 3D rendering and Framer Motion for animations. Here's how to approach implementation:

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Basic Structure and Components

1. Set up the base React component structure with empty placeholders
2. Implement the StarfieldBackground using Canvas API
3. Create layout for content sections without animations

### Phase 2: Three.js Solar System Integration

1. Set up Three.js scene, camera, and renderer in the EnhancedSolarSystem component
2. Implement central sun with glowing shader
3. Create orbital paths with custom shaders
4. Add planet objects with properties mapped to services
5. Implement star field using Three.js particles
6. Add camera controls and animation loop

The most complex shaders to focus on:

```javascript
// Sun glow shader fragment
fragmentShader: `
  uniform float time;
  uniform vec3 color1;
  uniform vec3 color2;
  varying vec3 vPosition;
  
  void main() {
    float intensity = 1.0 - length(vPosition) / 10.0;
    intensity = pow(intensity, 2.0);
    intensity *= 0.8 + 0.2 * sin(time * 2.0);
    vec3 color = mix(color1, color2, 0.5 + 0.5 * sin(time * 0.5));
    gl_FragColor = vec4(color, intensity * 0.8);
  }
`
```

### Phase 3: Animation Integration

1. Implement Framer Motion animations for content sections
2. Create staggered entrance animations for hero text
3. Add scroll-triggered animations for content visibility
4. Implement hover effects and interactive elements

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization

1. Implement memory management and cleanup for Three.js
2. Add conditional rendering based on device capabilities
3. Optimize shader complexity for mobile
4. Implement efficient event handling for scroll and resize

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Three.js Performance

Solution:
- Use `useRef` to maintain references to Three.js objects
- Proper cleanup in `useEffect` return function
- Optimize geometry with appropriate polygon counts
- Use instanced meshes for stars when possible

### Challenge 2: Shader Complexity

Solution:
- Simplify shader calculations for mobile devices
- Use uniform optimization techniques to reduce GPU cost
- Precompute values where possible instead of calculating in shaders

### Challenge 3: React + Three.js Integration

Solution:
- Maintain a clean separation between React state and Three.js scene
- Use refs to interact with the Three.js scene
- Handle resize events efficiently with debouncing

## Testing Strategy

1. Component rendering tests with React Testing Library
2. Performance benchmarking using RAF timing
3. Cross-browser testing focusing on WebGL compatibility
4. Mobile device testing with focus on touch interactions

## Implementation References

```javascript
// How to handle Three.js cleanup properly
useEffect(() => {
  // Setup code...
  
  return () => {
    // Proper Three.js cleanup
    scene.traverse(object => {
      if (object.geometry) object.geometry.dispose();
      if (object.material) {
        if (Array.isArray(object.material)) {
          object.material.forEach(material => material.dispose());
        } else {
          object.material.dispose();
        }
      }
    });
    renderer.dispose();
  };
}, []);
```

## Potential Customizations

The most flexible elements for customization are:

1. Planet data array - for adding/removing service representations
2. Shader colors and animation parameters
3. Animation timing and scroll triggers
4. Background star density and color distribution

This implementation offers significant visual impact while maintaining acceptable performance across devices when properly optimized.
