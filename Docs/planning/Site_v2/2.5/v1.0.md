I'll analyze the mission requirements and present a plan without making any edits yet.

# ü™ê TILE 4.13B Implementation Plan

## Current Assessment
Based on the MiniSystemLayout.jsx file and the requirements in TILE 4.13B, I need to improve the Earth layer styling and orbital alignments.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Earth Image Styling
- Replace the current div-based approach with a proper img element
- Position the Earth at the bottom of the component with proper masking
- Add subtle glow effects behind the Earth
- Apply appropriate z-indexing to integrate with space background

### 2. Orbit Adjustments
- Increase the orbit radius from 140px to 200px 
- Reposition orbital icons to prevent overlap with Earth
- Adjust y-offset to move icons slightly upward
- Ensure proper spacing between icons

### 3. Comet Path Refinements
- Modify comet angles to avoid vertical passes across Earth
- Focus on shallow diagonal trajectories (20¬∞-70¬∞, 110¬∞-160¬∞)
- Add curved paths that respect the Earth's arc
- Prevent z-index conflicts with Earth layer

### 4. Responsive Adjustments
- Scale Earth and orbit rings appropriately on mobile/tablet
- Add overflow control for smaller viewports
- Ensure visual harmony across all screen sizes

### 5. Performance Considerations
- Optimize animations for reduced motion when needed
- Ensure proper pointer-events handling
- Maintain clean separation of concerns between components

## Implementation Details
- Use img tag instead of background-image for better control
- Apply radial gradient mask to fade Earth edges into space
- Use bottom-aligned positioning instead of centered
- Add subtle purple/blue glow beneath Earth
- Increase orbit radius and adjust icon positions
- Modify comet animation paths and angles
- Test across multiple viewport sizes

No code changes will be made until you approve this plan. Shall I proceed with the implementation?
