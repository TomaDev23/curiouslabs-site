🧠 Perfectly received — we’re doing **TILE 4.4** the *CuriousLabs way*: grounded, founder-driven, real.

No fake features.  
No filler cards.  
Everything rooted in your actual product design and backend vision.

## 🚀 TILE 4.4 – Phase 1: Feature Grid Upgrade (Grounded in Reality)

We’ll define **6 real features per product** that:
- 🧠 Reflect their current purpose or planned architecture
- 🔗 Tie back to Aegis where appropriate
- 💬 Use clear, short titles + accurate 1-liner explanations
- 🎯 Designed for implementation into your Tailwind layout

🧠 Let’s lock in **TILE 4.4 – Phase 2: Anchor System & Scroll Targets**.  
This gives structure to each product page for future navigation, dynamic scroll, or deep links.

---

## 🧩 TILE 4.4 – Phase 2: Anchor Tags and Scroll Structure

### 🧭 Objective
Every product page gets **scrollable anchor sections** that:
- Let users navigate via hash links (e.g. `/products/aegis#features`)
- Prepare for internal page menus or smooth scroll effects
- Make the layout easier to extend or animate in TILE 4.5+

---

## 📐 Standard Anchor Structure Per Product Page

Each product page should use the following **ID tags**:

| Section | HTML ID | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Hero / Overview | `#overview` | Title, subtitle, CTA — already at the top |
| Feature Grid | `#features` | Section showing the 6 tiles (Phase 1 content) |
| Call-to-Action | `#cta` | Bottom banner with buttons (e.g. “Try Curious”) |

---

## ✅ Example JSX Implementation (Aegis Page)

```jsx
<section id="overview" className="pt-20 pb-10">
  <h1 className="text-5xl font-bold text-white text-center">Aegis</h1>
  <p className="text-lg text-center text-purple-300 mt-4">The AI core engine powering CuriousLabs</p>
</section>

<section id="features" className="bg-gradient-to-b from-black to-gray-900 py-16 px-4">
  <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-white text-center mb-8">Key Capabilities</h2>
  {/* Feature grid goes here */}
</section>

<section id="cta" className="bg-purple-800 text-white py-16 text-center">
  <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold">Want to power your own AI systems?</h3>
  <Link to="/contact" className="btn btn-primary mt-4">Talk to Us</Link>
</section>
```

---

## 🧠 Development Considerations

- **Use standard `id` attributes**, not refs — ensures browser hash scroll works out of the box
- Can later support **smooth scroll behavior** via Tailwind plugin or CSS `scroll-behavior: smooth;`
- Every page gets the same anchors for uniformity

---

## 🎯 Optional Future Use

- Navbar submenus (e.g. “Aegis → Features”)
- Button on `/products/index` that jumps directly to `#features`
- Docs-style sidebar nav (TILE 5.x)

# TILE 4.4 Implementation Plan — Feature Grid & Anchor Structure

## 🎯 Overview
TILE 4.4 enhances all CuriousLabs product pages with:
1. **Grounded Feature Grids** — six real, project-rooted features per product
2. **Anchor Tag System** — scrollable and linkable section markers (`#overview`, `#features`, `#cta`)

---

## 🧱 Phase 1: Feature Grid Implementation

### 🧪 Simulation Plan
1. **Review Current Structure**
   - Study how existing feature grids are rendered (HTML layout and classes)
2. **Build Feature Arrays**
   - Create six-feature arrays per product using data defined in TILE 4.4 planning
3. **Inject Feature Data into Each Product Page**
   - Add Tailwind-based grid rendering logic
   - Use consistent layout with responsive utilities (`grid-cols-1`, `sm:grid-cols-2`, `lg:grid-cols-3`)

### 🔧 Sample Feature Data Structure
```jsx
const features = [
  {
    title: "Decision Graph",
    description: "Uses state graphs to model runtime decisions and fallback chains.",
    icon: "🧠"
  },
  {
    title: "Agent Orchestration",
    description: "Powers AI modules like GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok in unified logic.",
    icon: "⚙️"
  },
  ...
];
```

### ✅ Expected Results
- Each product page renders its full 6-tile feature grid
- All icons/text are real, grounded, and styled via Tailwind

---

## 🧱 Phase 2: Anchor System Implementation

### 🔗 Scroll Target Standard
Each product page must include the following anchors:
- `#overview` — The hero/top section
- `#features` — The feature grid section
- `#cta` — The bottom call-to-action section

### 🧩 Example Section Structure
```jsx
<section id="overview" className="pt-20 sm:pt-24 pb-12 sm:pb-16">
  {/* Hero content */}
</section>

<section id="features" className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 py-6 sm:py-8 mb-12 sm:mb-16">
  <h2 className="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-8 sm:mb-12 text-center">
    Core Capabilities
  </h2>
  {/* Feature grid */}
</section>

<section id="cta" className="max-w-5xl mx-auto px-4 py-10 sm:py-16 text-center">
  {/* Final call-to-action block */}
</section>
```

### 🔍 Verification
- Navigate to each anchor via hash (e.g. `/products/aegis#features`)
- Ensure scroll behavior targets expected region
- Check that spacing looks correct across screen sizes

---

## 🚀 Execution Strategy

1. **Start with `Aegis.jsx`** as template reference
2. Implement `features[]` array and anchor structure inside `aegis.jsx`
3. Review layout and visual balance in browser (mobile + desktop)
4. Repeat same structure for:
   - `opspipe.jsx`
   - `moonsignal.jsx`
   - `curious.jsx`
   - `guardian.jsx`
5. Perform scroll target tests for all 5 products
6. Adjust spacing or styling as needed

---

## 📦 Output Summary
- All product pages now include real, structured feature content
- Each section is anchor-aware and scrollable
- Ready for future dynamic scroll nav or sidebar integration

Upon completion, TILE 4.4 will be formally sealed and deployed in sync with production branch.
