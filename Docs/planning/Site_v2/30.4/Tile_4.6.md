🧠 Perfect choice — the **Aegis** page is the backbone of the story. Let’s turn it from a visual sketch into a proper technical and use-case narrative.

# 🛠 TILE 4.6-A: Aegis Page Expansion — System Tech + Use Case Layer

### 🎯 Objective:
Evolve `/products/aegis` from visual showcase → **strategic anchor** with real substance. No fluff — just power.

---

## ✅ PHASE 1: System Architecture Summary (New Section: “Under the Hood”)

Add a block that explains how Aegis works technically:

```md
### 🧠 Under the Hood: How Aegis Works

- **State Machine Core**: All workflows run on a deterministic FSM that enforces valid transitions and trace logs.
- **Agent Control Layer**: Supports external AI agents (GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok) plugged into decision slots via config.
- **Modular Routing**: Output pipelines route to renderers, APIs, export systems, or fallbacks.
- **Contract Enforcement**: All actions and transitions are schema-bound, versioned, and audited.
- **Telemetry Bus**: Emits trace and status events throughout each session lifecycle.
```

---

## ✅ PHASE 2: Supported Use Cases Grid (New Section: “Use Cases”)

Add a `useCases` array and grid block like:

```jsx
const useCases = [
  {
    title: "Ghost Kitchens",
    description: "Parse operational docs, structure recipes, push metrics to staff dashboards.",
    icon: "🍜"
  },
  {
    title: "AI Accounting",
    description: "Batch receipts, sync to Xero, auto-categorize, request human review where uncertain.",
    icon: "📊"
  },
  {
    title: "Events & Media",
    description: "Ingest guest photos, rank by quality, display live at weddings or conferences.",
    icon: "📸"
  },
  {
    title: "Ops Debugging",
    description: "Detect and trace errors in AI workflows using live FSM replay and telemetry.",
    icon: "🛠"
  },
  {
    title: "Internal Tools",
    description: "Create CLI or bot interfaces powered by the same state-layer and contracts.",
    icon: "💼"
  },
  {
    title: "Custom SaaS",
    description: "White-label the Aegis runtime to power your own AI workflows or microtools.",
    icon: "🧱"
  }
]
```

Then render this as a matching grid under a new `Use Cases` heading.

## ✅ PHASE 3: Refined CTA Section

Modify the bottom section to invite two types of users:

- **Founders** — to explore Aegis as a backend
- **Engineers** — to plug into the runtime

```jsx
<section id="cta" className="...">
  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white text-center mb-4">Build Smarter With Aegis</h2>
  <p className="text-lg text-purple-300 text-center max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-8">
    Whether you're launching a startup, building an internal tool, or managing chaotic ops — Aegis is your AI-native engine.
  </p>
  <div className="flex justify-center gap-4">
    <a href="/contact" className="btn btn-primary">Talk to Us</a>
    <a href="/docs" className="btn btn-secondary">Explore Docs</a>
  </div>
</section>
```

---

## ☑️ Implementation Path

1. Insert “Under the Hood” section after Core Capabilities
2. Add `Use Cases` grid below that
3. Refactor CTA to match real tone
4. Keep all changes in Tailwind + modular style
