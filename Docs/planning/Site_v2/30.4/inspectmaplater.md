I'll compare the Site Map document with the current site structure to verify alignment and identify any differences.

# Site Map Comparison Report

Based on my analysis of the current site against the Site Map document, I've identified the following alignments and discrepancies:

## Key Alignments ✅

1. **Overall Structure**: The site follows the documented structure with main pages (Home, Products, CodeLab, Blog, About, Contact, Documentation) and product pages.

2. **Component Organization**: The components are organized as specified with NavBar, FooterMain, and other components in their proper locations.

3. **Asset Management**: The site correctly follows the asset path discipline:
   - Logo file is in `/public/images/`
   - Partner logos are in `/public/images/logos/`
   - SVG rendering is handled via the central assets.js utility

4. **Navigation Architecture**: 
   - NavBar is imported in index.jsx and remains sticky as specified
   - Routing is handled through React Router with Link components

## Discrepancies ⚠️

1. **Homepage Component Structure**:
   - Site Map specifies: `NavBar, Hero, LogoStrip, SolutionsPreview, FeedbackBlock, FooterMain`
   - Actual homepage imports: `NavBar, HeroMain, SolutionsPreview, FeedbackBlock, FooterMain`
   - The "LogoStrip" component appears to be missing from the home page implementation
   - "Hero" is called "HeroMain" in the implementation, which aligns with the warning about not using legacy Hero components

2. **Footer Implementation**:
   - Site Map references `Footer.jsx`, but the actual implementation uses `FooterMain.jsx`
   - There's also a `Footer_legacy.jsx` file in the components directory, which aligns with the recent recovery context mentioned in the documentation

3. **Component Naming**:
   - The Site Map uses generic names like "Hero" while implementation uses more specific names like "HeroMain"
   - This appears to be part of the TILE recovery work mentioned in the documentation

4. **Footer Layout**:
   - The actual FooterMain component has 4 columns (Brand, Quick Links, Products, Contact)
   - The Site Map shows a 4-column layout with different groupings (Products, Resources, Company, Connect)

5. **Visual Elements**:
   - While the core structure is present, some visual elements like the specific styles for buttons, cards, and headings would require a more detailed UI inspection to verify full compliance

## Summary

The current implementation generally adheres to the structure defined in the Site Map, with a few naming differences and the notable absence of the LogoStrip component on the homepage. These minor discrepancies appear to be consistent with the "TILE 4.2C recovery" described in the documentation, which mentions "enforcing strict component structure" and "re-adding NavBar to homepage."

The changes appear to be deliberate adaptations rather than errors, aimed at stabilizing the project while maintaining its core architecture. The codebase follows the "DO NOT DEVIATE" rules in terms of folder structure, asset management, and component organization.
