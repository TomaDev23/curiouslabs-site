# TILE 4.2C â€“ Visual Recovery Simulation Plan

I'll simulate the TILE 4.2C recovery task according to the provided instructions, focusing only on verification and minimal path fixes if needed. No file creation, component rewrites, or major changes.

## ðŸ“Š Task 1: Visual Asset Audit Simulation

I'll check if each SVG file exists in its specified location:

```powershell
# Check main logo
Test-Path public/images/logo.svg

# Check partner logos in logos directory
Test-Path public/images/logos/logo1.svg
Test-Path public/images/logos/logo2.svg
Test-Path public/images/logos/logo3.svg
Test-Path public/images/logos/logo4.svg
Test-Path public/images/logos/logo5.svg
```

If the `/public/images/logos/` directory doesn't exist, I'll report it but not create it.

## ðŸ“Š Task 2: LogoStrip.jsx Integrity Check Simulation

I'll examine the LogoStrip component:

```powershell
# Check if file exists
Test-Path src/components/LogoStrip.jsx
```

Then I'll read the file content to:
1. Verify it exists
2. Check for proper path references to logos
3. Confirm no placeholder content remains

I will NOT modify this file, only examine it.

## ðŸ“Š Task 3: NavBar Logo Check Simulation

I'll check the NavBar component:

```powershell
# Check if NavBar exists
Test-Path src/components/NavBar.jsx
```

Then I'll read the file to:
1. Check how the logo is referenced
2. Verify the path is correct (should be `/images/logo.svg`)

If I find an incorrect path, I would plan to carefully fix ONLY the path string.

## ðŸ“Š Task 4: Browser Testing Simulation

I'll check if the development server can be started:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

While I can't directly simulate browser behavior, I can check for:
1. Server start success
2. No immediate path-related errors in logs

## ðŸ“‘ Output: Report Creation Plan

I'll create a detailed report containing:
1. Status of each asset file (exists/missing)
2. Current path references in LogoStrip.jsx
3. Current path references in NavBar.jsx
4. Any path issues detected
5. Recommendations (path corrections only, if needed)

The report will be created at `Docs/reports/Tile_4.2C_Visual_Recovery.md`

## ðŸ”’ Important Safety Measures

Throughout this simulation, I will adhere to these constraints:
- No file creation (except the final report)
- No file deletion
- No component rewrites
- No placeholder assets
- Only path string corrections if absolutely necessary
- All actions documented in the report

This plan follows a verification-first approach with minimal intervention, focused solely on ensuring visual assets load correctly across the site.
