# TILE 4.2X-A â€” Final Product Page Visibility Verification Plan

I'll execute a comprehensive verification process to ensure all product pages are correctly implemented and visible, following these steps:

## Phase 1: File Existence Verification
```powershell
# Check if all product page files exist
Test-Path src/pages/products/curious.jsx
Test-Path src/pages/products/guardian.jsx
Test-Path src/pages/products/moonsignal.jsx
```

## Phase 2: Component Structure Analysis
```powershell
# Examine component export declarations
Get-Content src/pages/products/curious.jsx -TotalCount 10
Get-Content src/pages/products/guardian.jsx -TotalCount 10
Get-Content src/pages/products/moonsignal.jsx -TotalCount 10

# Check for JSX return statements
Select-String -Path src/pages/products/curious.jsx -Pattern "return \("
Select-String -Path src/pages/products/guardian.jsx -Pattern "return \("
Select-String -Path src/pages/products/moonsignal.jsx -Pattern "return \("
```

## Phase 3: Routing Configuration Validation
```powershell
# Verify imports in App.jsx
Select-String -Path src/App.jsx -Pattern "import (Curious|Guardian|MoonSignal)"

# Confirm route definitions
Select-String -Path src/App.jsx -Pattern "/products/(curious|guardian|moonsignal)"
```

## Phase 4: Import Dependencies Check
```powershell
# Verify critical dependencies are imported
Select-String -Path src/pages/products/curious.jsx -Pattern "import (NavBar|Footer)"
Select-String -Path src/pages/products/guardian.jsx -Pattern "import (NavBar|Footer)"
Select-String -Path src/pages/products/moonsignal.jsx -Pattern "import (NavBar|Footer)"
```

## Phase 5: Products Portal Integration Check
```powershell
# Verify product links in the product portal page
Select-String -Path src/pages/products/index.jsx -Pattern "(curious|guardian|moonsignal)"
```

## Phase 6: Patch Implementation (if needed)

### Scenario A: Missing File
If any file is missing, I'll recreate it using the template from existing product pages, ensuring:
- Correct import statements
- Properly named export function
- Complete component structure with all sections

### Scenario B: Component Export Issues
If the component export is incorrect, I'll update the file to ensure:
```jsx
export default function ProductName() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen">
      {/* Component content */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Scenario C: Routing Configuration Issues
If routing issues are found, I'll update App.jsx:
```jsx
// Add proper imports
import ProductName from './pages/products/productname.jsx';

// Ensure route element uses the component
<Route path="/products/productname" element={<ProductName />} />
```

## Phase 7: Final Verification
```powershell
# Test build process for errors
npm run build
```

I'll check:
- Build completes successfully without errors
- All product page files exist and export components properly
- Routing is correctly configured in App.jsx
- Product pages are referenced in the Products Portal

This plan provides a thorough verification process to ensure all product pages are correctly implemented and accessible, with clear steps to diagnose and fix any issues encountered.
