## üìè Scope Reminder

**MISSION SCOPE: Polish the existing `/dev/v4-cosmic` route with enhanced animations and visual styling. Do NOT:**

1. Change the core functionality of any components
2. Modify the routing architecture
3. Alter the page structure or section order
4. Add new pages or routes
5. Install additional dependencies without explicit approval
6. Change content or copy unless specifically needed for animations

**The focus is purely on visual enhancement and motion design while preserving all existing functionality.**

## üìú Rules Reminder

1. **Docs Are Law** - All implementation must trace to documented specifications in the Cosmic Harmony plan.

2. **Sacred Structure** - Do not rename or relocate folders. Component structure must match declared architecture.

3. **Stack Lock** - Use only:
   - React for components
   - React Router for navigation
   - TailwindCSS for styling (no CSS modules, Styled Components)
   - Existing animation libraries only

4. **Style Discipline** - Use only:
   - TailwindCSS utility classes
   - Custom colors defined in `tailwind.config.js`
   - Animation definitions in `tailwind.config.js`
   - No external CSS libraries

5. **Component Rules** - All components must be:
   - Exportable as standalone modules
   - Responsive across all breakpoints
   - Free of backend integrations
   - Rendered from their respective page files

6. **Asset Management** - All assets must be:
   - Centralized in `src/utils/assets.js`
   - Referenced from proper public directories
   - No external CDN links
   - No inline base64 encoded images

7. **Performance First** - Always prioritize:
   - Smooth animations (60fps)
   - Small bundle size
   - Efficient re-renders
   - Progressive enhancement

8. **Mobile First** - Design for mobile first, then enhance for larger screens.

9. **Accessibility** - Maintain accessibility standards while implementing visual enhancements.

10. **Systematic Implementation** - Approach each enhancement methodically and test thoroughly before moving to the next.

This mission will elevate the cosmic theme to new heights while maintaining the core structure and functionality of the existing site. The goal is to create a stunning, immersive experience without compromising performance or breaking existing features.
