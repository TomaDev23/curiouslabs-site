# 🏁 Strategic Reminders

- **No external libraries** — TailwindCSS only
- **Follow modular structure** — each page/component cleanly isolated
- **Focus on responsiveness** — mobile-first polish as per aesthetic scaffolding
- **No backend integrations yet** — forms/buttons are stub visuals only
- **Use our sacred CuriousLabs purple/blue palette**

# ⚡ Immediate Action Option

✅ **Ready to launch TILE 1.0:**  
> Build the Core Layout — Navbar with dropdown, Footer, and clean page routing.

**Includes:**
- New Navbar with dropdown menu (`Products > Aegis, OpsPipe, etc.`)
- New Footer
- Set up basic pages (index.jsx, codelab.jsx, about.jsx, contact.jsx, blog.jsx, products/*)

---

# ✨ Question Before We Launch T1.0

> 🧠 **Do you want the Navbar to show "Products" as a dropdown** directly?  
Or **"Products" as a click-to page** (`/products`) listing them?

Both are valid — different feel:

| Style | Behavior |
|:------|:---------|
| Dropdown | 🛫 Fast — see all products instantly from any page |
| Products Page | 🧠 Deeper — one central hub with nice visuals |

🛡️ **Commander, awaiting signal to fire T1.0 layout construction mission!**  
Would you like direct dropdown, products page, or hybrid? 🚀
