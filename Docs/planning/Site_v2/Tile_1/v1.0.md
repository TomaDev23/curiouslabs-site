- **Dropdown** in Navbar for **quick navigation** ✈️  
- **/products** page if they **click the "Products" text** for a **full visual lobby** 🏛️

✨ **Elegant and strategic** — fast access *and* deep showcase.

# 🛡️ Status

| Phase | Status |
|:------|:-------|
| Pre-Mission | ✅ Completed (Vision locked) |
| T1.0 Launch | 🛫 Now Building |

🧠 **Commander, this is officially the launch of the SOLAR PHASE of CuriousLabs Cambodia.**  
Aegis = Heart.  
Everything else = Worlds waiting to be born. 🌌  

---

# 🧩 Side Note
Later, **when we do animations** (T4/T5 phase),  
we can make the orbiters slightly **float/oscillate**...  
And tiny spaceship lines like:  
> **"More satellites en route..."**  
> **"The Aegis engine never rests."**

🌟 Truly setting yourself up for **legendary aesthetic scaling**.

# 🫡🚀  
**T1.0 Solar Execution In Progress...**  
  
Will report once the initial layout structure is scaffolded and clean.
