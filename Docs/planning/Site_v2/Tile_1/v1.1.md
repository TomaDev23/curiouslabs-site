I'll analyze the new site scope expansion request based on the documentation provided and prepare a detailed implementation plan before proceeding with any building. Let me review the existing structure and requirements.

# 🚀 Implementation Plan: Site Scope Expansion (TILE T1.0)

## 📋 Current Understanding
Based on the provided documentation, we're expanding from the current OpsPipe-focused single page to a full CuriousLabs portal site with multiple products and routes:

1. Current state: Single landing page showcasing OpsPipe
2. Target state: Multi-page site with Solar System model portal (Aegis at center)

## 🔍 Key Components to Build

### 1. Navigation System
- **Navbar.jsx** - Header with dropdown for Products
- **Footer.jsx** - Site-wide consistent footer

### 2. Page Structure
- Home (`/`) - CuriousLabs Cambodia portal
- Products portal (`/products`) - Solar system model of all products
- Product-specific pages:
  - `/products/aegis`
  - `/products/opspipe` (current landing page content)
  - `/products/moonsignal` 
  - `/products/curious`
  - `/products/guardian`
- Support pages:
  - `/codelab` (existing landing, adapted)
  - `/about`
  - `/contact`
  - `/blog`

### 3. New Components
- **AegisCenterCard.jsx** - Prominent central card for Aegis
- **OrbitProductCard.jsx** - Smaller cards for other products

## 🛠️ Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Structure
1. Create navigation components (responsive)
2. Set up routing framework
3. Create page stubs for all routes

### Phase 2: Products Portal
1. Build the solar system model with Aegis at center
2. Create card components with proper styling
3. Implement responsive layout (stacked on mobile)

### Phase 3: Content Migration
1. Move OpsPipe content to its dedicated route
2. Adapt existing content for the home page
3. Create minimal content for other product pages

## 📅 Development Steps

1. **Navigation Framework**
   - Navbar with dropdown functionality
   - Basic footer component

2. **Routing Setup**
   - Configure routes using React Router
   - Create page component stubs

3. **Solar Portal Layout**
   - AegisCenterCard component (larger, with glow effect)
   - OrbitProductCard components
   - Responsive grid layout

4. **Content Migration**
   - Move existing OpsPipe content to its page
   - Build home page with focus on CuriousLabs vision

5. **Styling & Polish**
   - Consistent branding across pages
   - Responsive design verification
   - Animation preparation for future phases

## ⚠️ Implementation Constraints

Per DO_NOT_DEVIATE.md:
- Use only TailwindCSS for styling (no custom CSS)
- Maintain current folder structure
- Components must be responsive and standalone
- No additional npm packages without approval
- No external component libraries

## 🧠 Key Technical Decisions

1. **Routing Implementation**:
   - Will need to confirm if React Router is already installed or needs approval
   - Alternatively, can use Next.js-style file-based routing if already implemented

2. **State Management**:
   - Will use React Context for minimal shared state (active route highlighting)
   - Keep page components as independent as possible

3. **Responsive Strategy**:
   - Mobile-first design using Tailwind breakpoints
   - Solar layout: vertical stack on mobile, orbital layout on desktop

## 📌 Questions Before Implementation

1. Is React Router already installed, or should we request it?
2. Should the current OpsPipe content be duplicated or moved to the new route?
3. Are there specific brand colors/assets for the other products?
4. Is there a preference for animation libraries for future phases?

Does this plan align with your vision for expanding the site scope? Would you like to adjust any aspects before I begin implementation?


🛡️💬 **Sharp catch, Commander — immediately correcting course!**  
Let's finalize the **Solar Plan** the right way:

---

# 🚀 FINAL Corrected Site Expansion Plan (TILE T1.0 Solar)

## 📋 Updated Understanding

| Area | Correction |
|:-----|:-----------|
| OpsPipe Landing Page | ✅ **Remains in /codelab** — NOT under /products/opspipe |
| OpsPipe Product Page (`/products/opspipe`) | ⚡ A new, clean, light page — will have its **own dedicated product story**, different tone than Codelab (no content duplication) |

---

# 🔍 Corrected Key Components to Build

### 1. Navigation System
- **Navbar.jsx** — "Products" dropdown + direct `/products` click
- **Footer.jsx** — Standard site-wide footer

### 2. Page Structure
- Home (`/`) — CuriousLabs Cambodia portal
- Products portal (`/products`) — Solar System layout
- Product-specific pages:
  - `/products/aegis` — (Mother Process - proud technical depth)
  - `/products/opspipe` — (Office in a Click - lighter marketing tone)
  - `/products/moonsignal` — (Trading Magic)
  - `/products/curious` — (Companion AI)
  - `/products/guardian` — (Safe Childhood)
- **Support pages**:
  - `/codelab` — ⚡ *Migrate current OpsPipe landing page here (heavy tech, TILE mission intake style)*
  - `/about`
  - `/contact`
  - `/blog`

# 🧠 Updated Development Steps

| Step | Task |
|:-----|:-----|
| 1️⃣ | Build Navbar + Footer |
| 2️⃣ | Setup clean file-based routing |
| 3️⃣ | Scaffold Pages (Home, Products Portal, Product Pages, CodeLab, About, Contact, Blog) |
| 4️⃣ | Build Solar Portal (Aegis Centerpiece) |
| 5️⃣ | Create AegisCenterCard.jsx and OrbitProductCard.jsx |
| 6️⃣ | Layout Products in orbital structure |
| 7️⃣ | Migrate OpsPipe existing content into `/codelab` |
| 8️⃣ | Create light marketing page for `/products/opspipe` (later) |

---

# 🧩 Correct Content Moves

| Page | Content Source | Notes |
|:-----|:---------------|:------|
| `/codelab` | Existing landing page | **Full OpsPipe TILE intake model** |
| `/products/opspipe` | New page | **Short marketing version — not copy of Codelab** |
| `/products/aegis` | New page | Full bragging rights — FSM, command core |
| Other product pages | New stubs | To be fleshed out later |

---

# 🧠 Strategic Reason for This Structure

✅ **Codelab** = serious tech intake for clients (CodeOps missions, debugging rescue).  
✅ **Products** = lighter, polished stories, for normal visitors to explore.  
✅ Keeps **professional and marketing pipelines separate** without confusion.

# 📜 Final Order of Operations

```plaintext
/src
  /components
    Navbar.jsx
    Footer.jsx
    AegisCenterCard.jsx
    OrbitProductCard.jsx
  /pages
    index.jsx                # Home page
    codelab.jsx               # Heavy landing (OpsPipe-style)
    about.jsx
    contact.jsx
    blog.jsx
    /products
      index.jsx              # Solar Portal
      aegis.jsx
      opspipe.jsx            # New lighter page
      moonsignal.jsx
      curious.jsx
      guardian.jsx
```

---

# 📌 Final Confirmations Before I Proceed:

✅ Move OpsPipe content → `/codelab`  
✅ Scaffold `/products/opspipe` fresh and empty for now  
✅ Solar System model, with Aegis dominant  
✅ TailwindCSS only, modular, responsive
