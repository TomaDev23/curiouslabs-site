# TILE 3.0 ‚Äî SOLAR STRUCTURE LOCKDOWN: Implementation Plan

Based on the mission outlined in TILE 3.0, I've prepared a detailed implementation plan with hard checkpoints after each phase.

## üéØ Overall Mission
Solidify the technical layout and scrolling behavior of the Solar System page (`/products`) while ensuring modularity, responsiveness, and stability before proceeding with design polish or animations.

## üìã Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Lock Grid Fields
**Objective:** Refactor the products page grid layout with perfect alignment of components.

**Steps:**
1. Examine current `/products/index.jsx` implementation
2. Ensure AegisCenterCard is perfectly centered
3. Align OrbitProductCard components symmetrically around Aegis
4. Fix spacing/margins between elements to prevent overlap

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/pages/products/index.jsx`
- `src/components/AegisCenterCard.jsx` (create if not exists)
- `src/components/OrbitProductCard.jsx` (create if not exists)

**Verification Points:**
- Desktop grid spacing is clean and symmetrical
- No visual overlapping elements
- Aegis maintains visual dominance
- Mobile view collapses properly (verified in DevTools)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CHECKPOINT 1:** Ready for review after grid layout refactoring is complete

### Phase 2: Strengthen Scroll Field
**Objective:** Ensure clean scrolling behavior across all routes, particularly for the products page.

**Steps:**
1. Verify ScrollToTop component functionality
2. Test route transitions for any ghost-scrolling issues
3. Ensure header sticks properly during navigation
4. Fix any scroll-related glitches

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/components/ScrollToTop.jsx`
- `src/pages/products/index.jsx`

**Verification Points:**
- Page always starts at top when navigating
- No delayed scroll behaviors
- Navigation remains smooth between routes
- Header behaves consistently across routes

**‚ö†Ô∏è CHECKPOINT 2:** Ready for review after scroll behavior refinement

### Phase 3: Mini Audit Hero Scroll
**Objective:** Ensure Hero scroll behaviors are isolated to the home page only.

**Steps:**
1. Examine current scroll behaviors on home page
2. Verify CodeLab page is free from Hero scroll behaviors
3. Clean up any shared animation logic that might affect other pages

**Files to Examine:**
- `src/pages/index.jsx`
- `src/pages/codelab.jsx`

**Verification Points:**
- Hero animations only appear on home page
- CodeLab has no hidden animated behaviors
- Clean separation of scroll behaviors between pages

**‚ö†Ô∏è CHECKPOINT 3:** Ready for review after Hero scroll audit

### Phase 4: Mobile Polish Pass
**Objective:** Ensure proper mobile responsiveness with clean vertical stacking.

**Steps:**
1. Test products page at various breakpoints
2. Fix horizontal overflow issues if any
3. Fine-tune margins and padding for mobile readability
4. Ensure smooth vertical stacking on smaller screens

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/pages/products/index.jsx`
- `src/index.css` (only if necessary)

**Verification Points:**
- No horizontal scroll bars on any breakpoint
- Clean vertical stacking on mobile
- Properly sized content on all screen sizes
- Touch-friendly spacing on mobile

**‚ö†Ô∏è CHECKPOINT 4:** Ready for review after mobile responsiveness improvements

### Phase 5: Security Header Patch (Mini Tile SH-2)
**Objective:** Enhance security with proper HTTP headers and 404 fallback.

**Steps:**
1. Create or update `vercel.json` with security headers
2. Set up 404 route fallback
3. Test headers in browser network tab

**Files to Modify:**
- `vercel.json`

**Implementation:**
```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        { "key": "X-Frame-Options", "value": "DENY" },
        { "key": "X-Content-Type-Options", "value": "nosniff" },
        { "key": "Strict-Transport-Security", "value": "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload" }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    { "handle": "filesystem" },
    { "src": "/(.*)", "status": 404, "dest": "/404" }
  ]
}
```

**Verification Points:**
- Security headers visible in network tab
- 404 page appears on invalid routes
- No console errors related to headers

**‚ö†Ô∏è CHECKPOINT 5:** Ready for review after security header implementation

### Phase 6: Component Cleanup (SolarSystem.jsx)
**Objective:** Modularize the Solar System layout into its own component.

**Steps:**
1. Create new `src/components/SolarSystem.jsx`
2. Move Solar layout code from `/products/index.jsx`
3. Implement clean props interface for future expansion
4. Update products page to use the new component

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- Create: `src/components/SolarSystem.jsx`
- Modify: `src/pages/products/index.jsx`

**Verification Points:**
- Clean separation of concerns
- SolarSystem component works independently
- Products page remains visually identical
- Component is prepared for future orbit animations

**‚ö†Ô∏è CHECKPOINT 6:** Ready for review after component modularization

## üß™ Test Across Browsers
After all phases are complete:
- Chrome (Desktop and Mobile Viewport)
- Safari (iPhone emulator)
- Firefox (Desktop)

## üö® Implementation Constraints
- Use TailwindCSS exclusively
- Favor IntersectionObserver over raw scroll listeners
- Create modular, focused components
- Avoid direct DOM manipulation
- Maintain clean git history
- Follow existing project structure

## üìù Progressive Verification Table

| Phase | Description | Key Verification Points | Status |
|-------|-------------|-------------------------|--------|
| 1 | Lock Grid Fields | Center alignment, symmetrical layout, no overlaps | üîÑ Pending |
| 2 | Strengthen Scroll Field | Scroll reset on navigation, no ghost scrolling | üîÑ Pending |
| 3 | Mini Audit Hero Scroll | Hero behaviors isolated to home page | üîÑ Pending |
| 4 | Mobile Polish Pass | No horizontal overflow, clean stacking | üîÑ Pending |
| 5 | Security Header Patch | Proper headers in network tab, 404 fallback | üîÑ Pending |
| 6 | Component Cleanup | Modularized SolarSystem component | üîÑ Pending |

I'll proceed with this plan only upon your approval. Each checkpoint will require explicit permission before moving to the next phase.
