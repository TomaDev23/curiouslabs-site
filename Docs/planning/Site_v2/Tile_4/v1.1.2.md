# TILE 4.1: Homepage Cleanup Lock

Commander corrected legacy leak. Cursor attempted partial overwrite with NavBar and Hero reinserted, violating TILE 4.0.

File was hard-overwritten with strict 4-block render:
- HeroMain
- SolutionsPreview
- FeedbackBlock
- FooterMain

Verified against DO_NOT_DEVIATE. Cursor halted, system restored.
