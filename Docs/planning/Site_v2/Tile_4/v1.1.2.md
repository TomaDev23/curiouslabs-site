# TILE 4.2A: Homepage Cleanup Lock

Commander corrected legacy leak. Cursor attempted partial overwrite with NavBar and Hero reinserted, violating TILE 4.0.

File was hard-overwritten with strict 4-block render:
- HeroMain
- SolutionsPreview
- FeedbackBlock
- FooterMain

Verified against DO_NOT_DEVIATE. Cursor halted, system restored.

## Additional Cleanup Operations

Following cleanup operations were performed:
- Removed `src/pages/index.jsx.backup` (stale homepage copy)
- Renamed `Footer.jsx` to `Footer_legacy.jsx` (still in use by multiple pages)
- Moved the `Hero/` directory to `legacy/Hero/` (still used by codelab.jsx)
- Updated all import paths in affected files

These changes ensure that the core homepage uses the new TILE 4.0 components while maintaining backward compatibility with pages that haven't been migrated yet.
