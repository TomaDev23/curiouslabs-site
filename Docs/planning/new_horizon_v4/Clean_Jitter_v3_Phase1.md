After carefully reviewing the jitter reduction master plan, I understand the phased approach and the specific objectives of each phase. The plan is well-structured and addresses the root causes of the jitter issues systematically.

To begin, I will focus on simulating and planning Phase 1: Lock Animation Timings. This phase aims to eliminate jitter caused by dynamic animation timing by standardizing the `duration`, `delay`, and `ease` properties across all animated components, removing any random or responsive values.

The target components for this phase are:
- `HeroPortal.jsx`
- `ServicesOrbital.jsx` 
- `Metrics.jsx`
- `ProjectsLogbook.jsx`
- (optional) `SpaceCanvas.jsx` floating particles if any `framer-motion` transitions exist

The plan is to apply a unified animation config to all `transition` properties in these components:

```js
transition={{
  duration: 0.3, 
  delay: 0.1,
  ease: 'easeOut'  
}}
```

For staggered animations, like cards in a group, the config will be:

```js
transition={{
  staggerChildren: 0.1
}}
```

It's crucial to remove any `isMobile` conditionals or `Math.random()` usage for delays in this phase. The focus is on ensuring clean, synced animation flow across all components.

To validate the changes, I will:
1. Locate all `transition={}` blocks in the target framer-motion components 
2. Replace all timing configs with the standardized values
3. Remove any `Math.random()` or `isMobile` logic in timing
4. Verify that changes are limited to `transition` properties only, without touching layout, classNames, or animation content

After implementing these changes, I will re-run the `/test_canvas` route and the main `/` route to confirm that the animations are smooth and synchronized across components, without any visible jitter.

By focusing solely on animation timing in this first phase, we can isolate and resolve a significant portion of the jitter issues related to inconsistent and dynamic timing values. This sets a solid foundation for the subsequent phases to address other aspects like responsive logic, blur effects, and canvas optimizations.

Please let me know if you would like me to proceed with executing Phase 1 according to this plan, or if you have any further guidance or adjustments before I begin.

Here is my detailed plan for executing Phase 1 of the jitter reduction initiative:

# 🎨 Phase 1: Lock Animation Timings

## 🎯 Objective
Eliminate animation-related jitter by standardizing `duration`, `delay`, and `ease` across all animated components, removing dynamic or random values.

## 📦 Target Components
- `src/components/home/v4/HeroPortal.jsx`
- `src/components/home/v4/ServicesOrbital.jsx`
- `src/components/Metrics.jsx` 
- `src/components/home/v4/ProjectsLogbook.jsx`
- `src/components/home/v4/SpaceCanvas.jsx` (optional, if `motion.div` exists)

## ✅ Implementation Steps

1. 🔍 Locate all `transition={}` blocks in framer-motion components

2. 🔧 Replace all timing configs with:
   ```js
   transition={{ 
     duration: 0.3,
     delay: 0.1, 
     ease: 'easeOut'
   }}
   ```

3. 🔀 For staggered animations, use:  
   ```js
   transition={{
     staggerChildren: 0.1
   }}
   ```

4. 🔥 Remove any `Math.random()` or `isMobile` conditionals in timing logic

5. ✅ Verify changes are limited to `transition` properties only
   - No modifications to layout, classNames, or animation content

## 🧪 Validation

1. Re-run `/test_canvas` route
   - Confirm animations are smooth and synchronized
   - Verify no visible jitter or timing inconsistencies

2. Re-run main `/` route 
   - Ensure animation timing changes are consistent sitewide
   - Validate no unintended side effects or visual regressions

## 📊 Success Metrics
- Elimination of animation-related jitter on `/test_canvas` 
- Smooth, synchronized animations across all target components
- No visual or layout regressions introduced
- Lighthouse performance scores remain stable

## 🚀 Rollout Plan
1. Implement changes in a new feature branch
2. Open a pull request for team review
3. Conduct thorough QA on the feature branch
4. Address any feedback or issues raised during review
5. Merge to main branch after approval
6. Monitor production for any post-launch issues

Please let me know if you would like me to proceed with this plan for Phase 1, or if you have any additional guidance or adjustments before I start the implementation.

I've carefully studied the plan for TILE 6.2.D.V — Jitter Isolation, focusing specifically on Phase 1: Lock Animation Timings. After examining the code, I confirm that the plan is clear, well-structured, and adheres to the "scalpel vs tractor" principle by making minimal, precise changes to only the necessary components.
Here's my assessment of Phase 1:
Target Components: The plan correctly identifies the key motion-heavy components:
HeroPortal.jsx
ServicesOrbital.jsx
Metrics.jsx
ProjectsLogbook.jsx
Current Issues Identified: I've confirmed these components use:
Dynamic Math.random() timing values
Responsive isMobile conditional durations
Inconsistent ease and delay values
Standardization Approach: The plan correctly specifies:
Using a consistent duration: 0.3 value
Applying a standard delay: 0.1 value
Setting ease: 'easeOut' uniformly
Using a fixed staggerChildren: 0.1 for sequential animations
Scalpel Precision: The plan maintains discipline by:
Targeting only transition properties
Not modifying any visual styling, layouts, or animation variants
Preserving all existing component behavior aside from timing
Clean Validation Strategy: The testing approach is appropriate:
Running /test_canvas to verify smoothness
Checking main route / for consistency
All the rules are properly considered, and the implementation follows the surgical approach needed for this delicate animation system. The plan correctly focuses on standardizing animation timing values without introducing any unnecessary changes.
I'm ready to proceed with Phase 1 implementation when you give the word


🧠 Confirmed, Commander — Phase 1 is locked, scoped, and crystal clear. Here's your final command capsule:

# ✅ PHASE 1 — LOCK ANIMATION TIMINGS

🧩 **TILE 6.3.A.1 – Static Timing Standardization**

## 🎯 Objective

Standardize all animation timing props across the main motion-heavy components to **eliminate jitter caused by randomness, device conditionals, or inconsistency**.

| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| HeroPortal               | `src/components/home/v4/HeroPortal.jsx`                                  |
| ServicesOrbital          | `src/components/home/v4/ServicesOrbital.jsx`                             |
| Metrics                  | `src/components/Metrics.jsx`                                             |
| ProjectsLogbook          | `src/components/home/v4/ProjectsLogbook.jsx`                             |
| *(Optional)* SpaceCanvas | `src/components/home/v4/SpaceCanvas.jsx` *(if any framer-motion timing)* |

## 🔧 Action Plan

### 1. **Remove all dynamic values from transition blocks**

* Eliminate:

  * `Math.random()` timing
  * `isMobile ? ... : ...` timing variations

### 2. **Replace with unified config**

```js
transition={{ 
  duration: 0.3,
  delay: 0.1,
  ease: 'easeOut'
}}
```

### 3. **For grouped animations**

```js
transition={{
  staggerChildren: 0.1
}}
```

> ✅ *Only modify `transition` props — do not touch animation types, layout, motion variants, or classNames*

---

## ✅ Validation Checklist

* [ ] `/test_canvas` renders smoothly without jitter
* [ ] `/` home route reflects consistent timing
* [ ] Lighthouse scores stable or improved
* [ ] No layout shifts, no visual regressions

## 🛠️ CURSOR TASK BLOCK

**📂 Files to Modify:**

* `HeroPortal.jsx`
* `ServicesOrbital.jsx`
* `Metrics.jsx`
* `ProjectsLogbook.jsx`

**🎯 Task:**
