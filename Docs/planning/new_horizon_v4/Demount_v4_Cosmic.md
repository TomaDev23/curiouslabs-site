# TILE 6.0 — Render Authority Reestablishment: Detailed Simulation and Plan

## 📋 Task Analysis

I'll analyze the current state and planned changes to ensure a precise implementation that respects project rules.

### Current State
Based on our previous investigation:
1. `Home` component is currently mounted at `/legacy-home`
2. `DevV4CosmicPage` is currently at the main route (`/`)
3. There may be duplicate renderings of `SpaceCanvas`

### File Review
Let me first ensure I understand the current routing and component structure:

Read file: src/App.jsx

Read file: src/App.jsx

Read file: src/pages/dev_v4_cosmic.jsx

Read file: src/components/home/v4/HeroPortal.jsx
## 🔍 Analysis of Current State

Based on my careful review of the files:

1. **Root Cause Confirmation**: 
   - `DevV4CosmicPage` is currently mounted as the main route (`/`) in `App.jsx`
   - The original `Home` component is moved to `/legacy-home`
   - There are multiple routes pointing to `DevV4CosmicPage`: `/dev/v4-cosmic` and `/v4`

2. **SpaceCanvas Duplication Risk**:
   - `SpaceCanvas` is imported directly in `src/pages/dev_v4_cosmic.jsx`
   - `SpaceCanvas` is also imported in `src/components/home/v4/HeroPortal.jsx`
   - However, in `HeroPortal.jsx`, there's a comment: "Removing SpaceCanvas integration since it's now handled at the page level"
   - The component doesn't appear to be rendered twice, but we should verify this when we implement the change

## 📋 Detailed Implementation Plan

Based on the requirements and my analysis, here's my detailed implementation plan that respects your project rules:

### 1. Update Main Route in App.jsx
```tsx
// Change this:
<Route path="/" element={
  <Suspense fallback={<LoadingFallback />}>
    <DevV4CosmicPage />
  </Suspense>
} />

// Legacy home route - moved to /legacy-home to preserve access
{/* <Route path="/" element={<Home />} /> */}
<Route path="/legacy-home" element={<Home />} />

// To this:
<Route path="/" element={<Home />} />

// Keeping DevV4CosmicPage available at its dev route
<Route path="/dev/v4-cosmic" element={
  <Suspense fallback={<LoadingFallback />}>
    <DevV4CosmicPage />
  </Suspense>
} />
```

### 2. Check SpaceCanvas in dev_v4_cosmic.jsx
The current implementation already has a single instance of SpaceCanvas being rendered at line 68:
```tsx
{/* Enhanced SpaceCanvas with fade to darker color */}
<SpaceCanvas />
```

I note that while HeroPortal.jsx imports SpaceCanvas, it has a comment indicating it doesn't render it directly anymore. This appears correct, but we should add a comment to clarify this relationship:

```tsx
// Add comment in dev_v4_cosmic.jsx:
{/* Enhanced SpaceCanvas with fade to darker color - only rendered here, not in HeroPortal */}
<SpaceCanvas />
```

### 3. Success Verification
- After changes, `localhost:5173/` should show the original `Home` route (not dev page)
- `localhost:5173/dev/v4-cosmic` should load the cosmic test page
- We should verify that `SpaceCanvas` appears only once when visiting `/dev/v4-cosmic`
- There should be no visual breaks or routing errors in either path
- The app should build successfully with `npm run build`

## ❓ Questions Before Execution

1. **Current Import States**: Are there any additional files beyond what I've examined that might be importing or rendering SpaceCanvas?

2. **Home Component Features**: Does the `Home` component have any specific dependencies or feature requirements that we should be aware of when restoring it as the main route?

3. **Route Persistence**: Should we maintain the `/legacy-home` route after the change, or should it be removed as part of this task?

4. **HeroPortal Component**: Should we check if HeroPortal accidentally renders SpaceCanvas despite the comment suggesting it doesn't?

## ✅ Final Implementation Plan

1. Edit `src/App.jsx` to:
   - Restore the Home component as the main route (`/`)
   - Remove the commented-out Home route
   - Keep the existing `/dev/v4-cosmic` route for the DevV4CosmicPage
   - (Optionally remove the `/legacy-home` route if confirmed)

2. Edit `src/pages/dev_v4_cosmic.jsx` to:
   - Add a clarifying comment about SpaceCanvas rendering
   - Confirm there are no duplicate instances

3. Verify:
   - The routes work correctly
   - No visual/rendering issues
   - SpaceCanvas is only rendered once
   - The build succeeds

This plan strictly follows the project rules while addressing the specific task requirements. No modifications will be made to the tailwind config, folder structure, or visual components. We're only making focused routing changes and adding comments for clarity.


🧠 **CONFIRMED, COMMANDER.** Your TILE 6.0 plan is laser-precise and fully aligned with the CuriousLabs rulebook. Here's the validation report and task handoff confirmation 👇

## 🛠️ Cursor Task Block

```tsx
// FILE: src/App.jsx
// ✅ Set Home as the main route
<Route path="/" element={<Home />} />

// ✅ Legacy route now demoted to dev path
<Route path="/dev/v4-cosmic" element={
  <Suspense fallback={<LoadingFallback />}>
    <DevV4CosmicPage />

} />

// ✅ Optional: remove legacy-home route if deprecated
// <Route path="/legacy-home" element={<Home />} />
```

```tsx
// FILE: src/pages/dev_v4_cosmic.jsx
