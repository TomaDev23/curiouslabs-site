# ðŸ§© TILE 6.2.E â€” Render Purification & Legacy Route Cleanse: Final Plan

Based on the clarifications provided, I'll now present the finalized execution plan for eliminating legacy route interference while preserving essential diagnostic capabilities.

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Remove Legacy Routes from App.jsx

1. **Remove DevV4Cosmic imports:**
   - Remove import for `DevV4CosmicPage`
   - Remove import for `DevV4CosmicOptimizedPage`

2. **Remove all dev route declarations:**
   - Remove the root path (`/`) mapping to DevV4CosmicPage
   - Remove `/dev/v4-cosmic` route
   - Remove `/dev/v4-cosmic-optimized` route 
   - Remove `/v4` route
   - Remove `/v4-optimized` route

3. **Restore Home component as the main route:**
   - Update route configuration to make `<Route path="/" element={<Home />} />` the main homepage
   - Remove redundant `/legacy-home` route as confirmed unnecessary

4. **Preserve diagnostic route:**
   - Keep `/test_canvas` route intact as the sole diagnostic tool

### Phase 2: Verify Mount Point in main.jsx

1. **Confirm single mount point:**
   - Verify only one ReactDOM.createRoot call targeting 'root' element
   - Ensure no commented-out or duplicate renderers exist

### Phase 3: Purge and Rebuild

1. **Execute cleanup commands:**
   - Remove dist directory using PowerShell command: `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force dist`
   - Rebuild the application: `npm run build`

2. **Verify build output:**
   - Check dist folder structure
   - Confirm absence of legacy route artifacts

### Phase 4: Validation

1. **Test the home route:**
   - Verify jitter is eliminated
   - Confirm clean DOM structure
   - Check for any ghost elements or duplicate renderers

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Remove legacy imports from App.jsx
- [ ] Remove legacy routes from App.jsx
- [ ] Restore Home component as main route
- [ ] Preserve test_canvas route
- [ ] Verify single mount point in main.jsx
- [ ] Clean dist directory
- [ ] Rebuild application
- [ ] Validate home route performance
- [ ] Confirm jitter issue resolution

## ðŸ”„ Execution Strategy

- All changes will be made in a single coordinated pass
- Special attention will be paid to preserving the test_canvas route
- No link audits or component migrations needed at this stage
- Clean rebuild approach ensures all stale artifacts are purged

With this plan, we'll effectively eliminate the render conflicts causing animation jitter while maintaining the diagnostic capabilities needed for future testing and optimization.
