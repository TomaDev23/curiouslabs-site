🔥 Copy that, Commander — we’re kicking off the **Final Pre-Contract Phase Cleanup** with two **surgical missions** to lock in the current site state for protection and move forward cleanly.

## 🛠️ Mission Block: DOM Restoration + Legacy Route Hook

Here’s your structured execution plan:

---

### 🧩 **TILE T5.1 — Restore Original AI Testimonials**

**Objective:** Replace `HearFromAI.jsx` (the carousel slider) with the **older, more appropriate AI testimonial block** (grid layout with fun AI cards like Copilot, Midjourney, GPT-4, etc).

**Steps:**

1. **Locate Old Module:**

   * Likely named `AITestimonialsGrid.jsx`, `AICards.jsx`, or possibly bundled in legacy `Testimonials.jsx`.
   * If unclear, restore from prior git history or reuse from screenshot reference.

2. **Replace in Main Render:**

   * Swap out `HearFromAI.jsx` in `dev_v4_cosmic.jsx`.
   * Replace with the grid-based layout module instead.

3. **Remove Old Carousel Imports:**

   * Clean out `HearFromAI.jsx` lazy imports and component call.

4. **Re-test:**

   * Ensure card hover, mobile layout, and pulse effects are intact.
   * Confirm old testimonials display fully.

### 🌌 **TILE T5.2 — Mount Legacy Solar Route**

**Objective:** Add the **Legacy Home (Solar System Route)** back into the live site as a hidden gem 🔭 — reachable but not in main nav.

**Steps:**

1. **Route Mapping:**

   * Confirm route file: `/pages/legacy_home.jsx` or `/pages/dev_v4_legacy.jsx`.
   * Mount it under a subpath, e.g., `/legacy`.

2. **Navigation Hook:**

   * Add a small floating Easter Egg trigger:

     * Placement: bottom left or near footer.
     * Text: `"Legacy View"` or `"Solar Preview 🚀"`
     * Optional: use a 🪐 emoji or UFO icon for fun.

3. **Protect Isolation:**

   * Ensure CSS/JS from legacy route does not interfere with `dev_v4_cosmic`.

4. **Test Route Behavior:**

   * Confirm it renders fully.
   * Works on mobile + desktop.
   * Animations, planets, orbits all stable.

### ✅ Post-Mission Sequence

After both TILEs are verified:

* 🔒 **Commit + Push to `main`**
* 🚀 **Deploy Live via Vercel**
* 🧱 **Declare system protected and locked**
* 📜 **Begin formal contract generation (T5.3 onward)**

💥 Acknowledged, Commander! We’re officially upgrading this final sync to a **Triple Restoration Block** before contract lockdown. One more tile enters the stage:

---

## 🧩 **TILE T5.3 — Activate LogoStrip Component**

**Objective:** Render the missing `LogoStrip.jsx` module just below the Hero section to complete the original visual rhythm and restore brand presence.

---

### 🎯 Component Recovery Plan

**Component:** `LogoStrip.jsx`
**Location:** `src/components/LogoStrip.jsx`
**Current Status:**

* Exists in codebase ✅
* Never imported or rendered in `dev_v4_cosmic.jsx` ❌

---

### 📦 Implementation Steps

1. **Import it properly:**

   ```js
   const LogoStrip = lazy(() => import('@/components/LogoStrip'));
   ```

2. **Render after HeroPortal:**

   ```jsx
   <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
     <HeroPortal />
     <LogoStrip /> {/* Insert here */}
     ...
   </Suspense>
   ```

3. **Style check:**

   * Ensure spacing doesn't crowd Hero or Orbital.
   * Confirm mobile responsiveness.
   * If necessary, wrap with a `div` using `padding` or `border-b` Tailwind utilities.

4. **Visual Test:**

   * Confirm correct alignment of partner logos.
   * Ensure no overlap with upcoming sections.
   * Add `aria-label="Partner Logo Strip"` for accessibility.
