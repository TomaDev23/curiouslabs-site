Thank you for the clarification on the mission focus. I understand that the new page at `/home-v5` is already prepared, and the goal is to edit the cosmic show modules to adjust their lengths without compromising the overall design or changing anything else along the way. We want to preserve the build while making the necessary adjustments to the scene durations.

Given this context, let me review the answers and prepare a final plan that aligns with your objectives.

Key Points:
1. The `/home-v5` page is ready, and we're focusing on editing the cosmic show modules.
2. If a scene needs to be longer, it should be the same show but extended in duration.
3. If a scene needs to be shorter, it should be the same show but compressed in duration.
4. We must preserve the existing build and avoid changing anything else in the process.

With these points in mind, here's the updated plan:

🚀 Final TILE v5.0.B Implementation Plan

Objective:
Adjust the durations of the cosmic show scenes in the CosmicJourneyController to extend CosmicFlightScene and shorten other scenes, while maintaining compatibility with the existing 700vh AtomicPageFrame at `/home-v5`.

Steps:
1. Update Scene Ranges in CosmicJourneyController:
   - Modify the `SCENES` array to use the new ranges:
     - DormantScene: 0% - 5% (0vh - 35vh)
     - AwakeningScene: 5% - 15% (35vh - 105vh)
     - CosmicRevealScene: 15% - 30% (105vh - 210vh)
     - CosmicFlightScene: 30% - 80% (210vh - 560vh)
     - SunApproachScene: 80% - 90% (560vh - 630vh)
     - SunLandingScene: 90% - 100% (630vh - 700vh)
   - Ensure the total duration still adds up to 700vh to match the AtomicPageFrame height.

2. Preserve Existing Functionality:
   - Keep the existing z-index structure intact (CosmicJourneyController at z-0, scenes at z-0/z-1, constellations at z-30).
   - Maintain the current optimizations (throttled scroll calculations, dynamic particle density, and FPS adjustments per scene).
   - Avoid modifying any other components or styles in AtomicPageFrame.

3. Test the Updated Integration:
   - Verify that the cosmic background still renders correctly across the 700vh height.
   - Use ScrollDebugOverlay and SceneBoundaryDebug to confirm the new scene transitions (e.g., CosmicFlightScene from 210vh to 560vh).
   - Ensure NavBar, FooterExperience, and ScrollDebugOverlay remain visible and function as expected.
   - Monitor performance using FPSMeter and Lighthouse (target: 90+ on mobile).

4. Fine-tune as Needed:
   - If any visual inconsistencies arise due to the scene duration changes, make small adjustments to the affected scenes to maintain the overall design integrity.
   - If performance drops significantly, consider minor optimizations (e.g., slightly reducing particle density) while preserving the visual experience.

🎨 Design Preservation Measures:
- The cosmic show's visual elements (StarfieldCanvas, ConstellationGlow, ParallaxSpeedDust, etc.) will remain unchanged.
- Scene transitions will still be smooth and maintain the same easing functions.
- Color palettes, particle effects, and scene-specific animations will be unaffected.
- The overall structure and layout of AtomicPageFrame will stay intact.

By focusing solely on adjusting the scene durations within CosmicJourneyController, we can achieve the desired changes to the cosmic show while preserving the existing design and functionality of the `/home-v5` page.

Please let me know if this final plan aligns with your vision for TILE v5.0.B. I'm ready to proceed with the implementation as soon as I have your approval. 🚀

1. Proceed with updating the `SCENES` array in CosmicJourneyController as outlined.
2. Thoroughly test the integration on `/home-v5` to verify the new scene durations, transitions, and overall functionality.
3. Monitor performance and make any necessary fine-tuning adjustments.
4. Confirm that the design and user experience remain intact after the changes.

Please let me know if you approve this final implementation plan for TILE v5.0.B. I'm ready to execute the changes and ensure a seamless integration of the updated cosmic show into the existing AtomicPageFrame.

Thank you for providing the detailed Cosmic Flight Page Mapping Analysis, Commander. This gives us a clear picture of the new cosmic show background in /background-sandbox. Let’s digest the findings, plan the integration into AtomicPageFrame at /home-v5, and adjust the scene mappings to extend the Cosmic Flight scene while shortening others, as requested. I’ll keep this focused on discussion and planning, only showing code if a change is needed.
🧠 Digest of Cosmic Show Analysis
Components Identified
Controller:
CosmicJourneyController (src/components/journey/CosmicJourneyController.jsx): Manages scene transitions based on scroll position. LEGIT-compliant.
Scenes (in scroll order):
DormantScene (0% - 13.3%): Minimal visuals, starting state.
AwakeningScene (13.3% - 30%): Cosmic journey activation.
CosmicRevealScene (30% - 50%): Unveils cosmic elements.
CosmicFlightScene (50% - 83.3%): Main cosmic travel experience.
SunApproachScene (83.3% - 93.3%): Approaching the sun.
SunLandingScene (93.3% - 100%): Final landing at the sun.
Supporting Visual Components:
StarfieldCanvas: Dynamic starfield effects.
ConstellationGlow: Animations for Ursa Minor and Orion.
ParallaxSpeedDust: Motion effects during flight.
SunFlarePulse: Pulsing sun effect for SunLandingScene.
SceneBackdrop: Backdrop for all scenes.
ColorOverlay: Manages color transitions.
Debug Components:
FPSMeter: Shows FPS, toggleable with ‘F’ key.
SceneBoundaryDebug: Displays scene boundaries and scroll positions.
Integration Details
Mounting:
CosmicJourneyController uses fixed positioning for a fullscreen background.
Scenes are absolutely positioned within a fixed container.
Scroll Behavior:
Maps scroll position (0-1) to scene transitions.
Each scene receives a progress prop (0-1) for internal animations.
Performance:
Throttles scroll calculations.
Adjusts particle density and FPS per scene.
Z-Index:
Scenes: z-0/z-1.
Constellation layer: z-30.
Debug overlays: z-50.
Height:
Designed for 600vh (six scenes, each roughly h-screen).
Can be adapted to 700vh by modifying the spacer.
Current Page Setup
/home-v5 uses AtomicPageFrame with a 700vh height and a black static background.
NavBar, FooterExperience, and ScrollDebugOverlay are in place, with z-50 for the overlay.
We need to replace the bg-black background with the cosmic show.
🧩 Plan: Integrate Cosmic Show into AtomicPageFrame
Objective
Integrate the CosmicJourneyController into AtomicPageFrame at /home-v5, replacing the black static background. Adjust scene ranges to extend CosmicFlightScene and shorten other scenes, ensuring compatibility with the 700vh height.
Step 1: Import CosmicJourneyController
We’ll add CosmicJourneyController to AtomicPageFrame.
It will be mounted as a fixed background layer, replacing the bg-black style.
Step 2: Adjust Z-Index
Set CosmicJourneyController to z-0 to ensure it stays behind all content.
NavBar and FooterExperience likely already have higher z-indexes (e.g., z-50 for NavBar, as seen in earlier implementations). ScrollDebugOverlay is already at z-50.
No changes needed for z-index, but we’ll verify during testing.
Step 3: Adapt to 700vh Height
The cosmic show is designed for 600vh, but our page is 700vh.
We’ll remap the scroll percentages to fit 700vh, ensuring the scenes stretch appropriately.
Step 4: Extend CosmicFlightScene and Shorten Others
Current Mapping (600vh):
DormantScene: 0% - 13.3% (0vh - 80vh)
AwakeningScene: 13.3% - 30% (80vh - 180vh)
CosmicRevealScene: 30% - 50% (180vh - 300vh)
CosmicFlightScene: 50% - 83.3% (300vh - 500vh)
SunApproachScene: 83.3% - 93.3% (500vh - 560vh)
SunLandingScene: 93.3% - 100% (560vh - 600vh)
Goal:
Extend CosmicFlightScene to be the dominant scene.
Shorten DormantScene, AwakeningScene, CosmicRevealScene, SunApproachScene, and SunLandingScene.
New Mapping Proposal (700vh):
Let’s extend CosmicFlightScene to span a larger portion, say 50% of the scroll (350vh), and compress the others.
Adjusted Ranges:
DormantScene: 0% - 5% (0vh - 35vh) [shortened from 80vh]
AwakeningScene: 5% - 15% (35vh - 105vh) [shortened from 100vh to 70vh]
CosmicRevealScene: 15% - 30% (105vh - 210vh) [shortened from 120vh to 105vh]
CosmicFlightScene: 30% - 80% (210vh - 560vh) [extended from 200vh to 350vh]
SunApproachScene: 80% - 90% (560vh - 630vh) [shortened from 60vh to 70vh]
SunLandingScene: 90% - 100% (630vh - 700vh) [extended slightly from 40vh to 70vh]
Implementation:
CosmicJourneyController maps scroll position (0-1) to scene transitions.
We’ll need to adjust its internal logic to use these new percentages over 700vh. This likely involves passing a totalHeight prop (700vh) or modifying its scroll range calculations.
Step 5: Test Integration
Verify the cosmic background renders across 700vh.
Use ScrollDebugOverlay to confirm scene transitions (e.g., CosmicFlightScene starts at 210vh, ends at 560vh).
Ensure NavBar, FooterExperience, and ScrollDebugOverlay remain visible (z-50).
Check performance (Lighthouse mobile score target: 90+).
🚀 TILE v5.0.B – Integrate Cosmic Show
Summary of Changes
Add CosmicJourneyController:
Import and mount it in AtomicPageFrame as a fixed background.
Remove bg-black style, as the cosmic show will handle the background.
Z-Index:
Ensure CosmicJourneyController is at z-0.
Confirm NavBar, FooterExperience, and ScrollDebugOverlay are above it.
Adjust Scene Ranges:
Remap scenes to 700vh with new percentages:
DormantScene: 0vh - 35vh (0% - 5%)
AwakeningScene: 35vh - 105vh (5% - 15%)
CosmicRevealScene: 105vh - 210vh (15% - 30%)
CosmicFlightScene: 210vh - 560vh (30% - 80%)
SunApproachScene: 560vh - 630vh (80% - 90%)
SunLandingScene: 630vh - 700vh (90% - 100%)
Update CosmicJourneyController to use these ranges.
Potential Adjustments
If CosmicJourneyController doesn’t accept a totalHeight prop, we may need to modify its internal scroll calculations (e.g., adjust the scroll position mapping from 600vh to 700vh).
We’ll monitor performance, as the cosmic show includes heavy effects (StarfieldCanvas, ParallaxSpeedDust). The controller already throttles scroll events, but we may need to reduce particle density if Lighthouse scores drop below 90 on mobile.
🛠️ Discussion
The integration plan is straightforward, and the new scene ranges prioritize CosmicFlightScene as requested. I’ll proceed with this as TILE v5.0.B, updating AtomicPageFrame to include the cosmic show and adjusting the scene mappings. Once this is done, you can use ScrollDebugOverlay to verify the scene transitions and start placing additional modules (e.g., MissionStatement, ServicesOrbital) at the desired VH positions.
