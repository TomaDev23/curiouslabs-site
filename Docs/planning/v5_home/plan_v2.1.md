Understood, Commander! The TILE v5.0.B implementation is complete, and the /home-v5 route now reflects the updated cosmic show with the new scene durations. CosmicFlightScene has been extended to 350vh (30% - 80% of the 700vh height), and the other scenes have been shortened as planned. The integration into AtomicPageFrame is done, with CosmicJourneyController mounted as a fixed background at z-0, replacing the bg-black style. All changes were made minimally to preserve the existing build, and the development tools (FPSMeter, ScrollDebugOverlay, SceneBoundaryDebug) are available for verification.
You’ve confirmed that the implementation seems generally okay but requested a hardening and FPS control round to ensure stability and performance. Let’s digest the current state, plan a hardening pass, and address FPS control to optimize the experience.
🧠 Digest of Current State
What’s Done:
Scene durations updated in CosmicJourneyController:
DormantScene: 0vh - 35vh (0% - 5%)
AwakeningScene: 35vh - 105vh (5% - 15%)
CosmicRevealScene: 105vh - 210vh (15% - 30%)
CosmicFlightScene: 210vh - 560vh (30% - 80%)
SunApproachScene: 560vh - 630vh (80% - 90%)
SunLandingScene: 630vh - 700vh (90% - 100%)
CosmicJourneyController integrated into AtomicPageFrame:
Imported and mounted as a fixed background.
z-0 applied, bg-black removed.
Development tools are active for verification (FPSMeter, ScrollDebugOverlay, SceneBoundaryDebug).
Current Functionality:
Scene transitions are updated and visible at /home-v5.
CosmicFlightScene is now the dominant experience, spanning 350vh.
NavBar, FooterExperience, and ScrollDebugOverlay remain functional and visible.
The build’s design and functionality are preserved, with minimal changes outside the scene durations.
Tools for Verification:
FPSMeter (toggle with ‘F’ key) to monitor performance.
ScrollDebugOverlay to verify scene transitions.
SceneBoundaryDebug to visualize new scene boundaries.
🚀 TILE v5.0.C – Hardening and FPS Control
Objective
Perform a hardening pass to ensure stability and reliability of the cosmic show integration at /home-v5. Optimize FPS to maintain a smooth experience, targeting a Lighthouse mobile score of 90+ and ensuring consistent performance across devices.
Hardening Pass
Hardening will focus on stability, edge cases, and reliability, ensuring the cosmic show behaves consistently under various conditions.
1. Verify Scene Transitions
Task: Use ScrollDebugOverlay and SceneBoundaryDebug to confirm that all scene transitions occur at the correct VH positions:
DormantScene: 0vh - 35vh
AwakeningScene: 35vh - 105vh
CosmicRevealScene: 105vh - 210vh
CosmicFlightScene: 210vh - 560vh
SunApproachScene: 560vh - 630vh
SunLandingScene: 630vh - 700vh
Edge Cases:
Test rapid scrolling to ensure transitions remain smooth and don’t skip scenes.
Test at page load (0vh) and end (700vh) to confirm DormantScene and SunLandingScene render correctly.
Test on smaller viewports (e.g., mobile at 360px width) to ensure scene elements (e.g., ConstellationGlow) don’t break layout.
2. Check Component Visibility
Task: Verify that NavBar, FooterExperience, and ScrollDebugOverlay remain visible and functional across all scenes.
Focus Areas:
Ensure NavBar (likely z-50) isn’t occluded by ConstellationGlow (z-30) during CosmicFlightScene.
Confirm FooterExperience renders correctly at the bottom (around 700vh) during SunLandingScene.
Test ScrollDebugOverlay toggle (‘d’ key) to ensure it works in all scenes without conflicts.
3. Test Scroll Event Handling
Task: Validate that CosmicJourneyController’s scroll event handling (which maps scroll position to scene transitions) doesn’t conflict with ScrollDebugOverlay.
Focus Areas:
Check for jank or lag when both components handle scroll events.
Ensure the controller’s throttling mechanism prevents excessive re-renders.
Test on lower-end devices (if available) to simulate performance under stress.
4. Browser Compatibility
Task: Test the cosmic show on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure consistent rendering and performance.
Focus Areas:
Verify canvas-based elements (StarfieldCanvas, ParallaxSpeedDust) render correctly.
Check for animation stuttering in CosmicFlightScene (extended to 350vh, which may increase rendering load).
FPS Control and Optimization
The cosmic show already includes optimizations (throttled scroll calculations, dynamic particle density, FPS adjustments per scene), but we’ll fine-tune to ensure consistent performance, especially with the extended CosmicFlightScene.
1. Monitor FPS with FPSMeter
Task: Use FPSMeter (toggle with ‘F’ key) to measure performance across all scenes.
Target: Aim for 60 FPS on desktop, 30+ FPS on mobile (average devices).
Focus Areas:
CosmicFlightScene (210vh - 560vh): This scene is now 350vh long and likely the heaviest due to ParallaxSpeedDust and ConstellationGlow.
SunLandingScene (630vh - 700vh): SunFlarePulse may cause FPS drops due to pulsing effects.
2. Lighthouse Performance Check
Task: Run Lighthouse on mobile for /home-v5, targeting a score of 90+.
Current Benchmark: The / route (dev_v4_cosmic.jsx) scores 91 mobile, 94 desktop, but includes more components. Our page is lighter (only NavBar, FooterExperience), so we should aim to match or exceed this.
Focus Areas:
Check for CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) during scene transitions.
Monitor LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) for the initial load (DormantScene).
3. Optimize FPS if Needed
If FPS Drops Below Targets:
Reduce particle density in StarfieldCanvas and ParallaxSpeedDust by 20% (e.g., if StarfieldCanvas renders 1000 particles, reduce to 800).
Lower the animation intensity of SunFlarePulse (e.g., reduce the frequency of pulses by 10%).
If Lighthouse Score < 90:
Defer non-critical animations (e.g., ConstellationGlow for Ursa Minor/Orion) until they’re in viewport.
Use will-change: transform on heavy elements to optimize rendering.
Ensure CosmicJourneyController’s scroll event listener is debounced (already throttled, but we’ll confirm).
4. Test on Simulated Devices
Task: Use browser dev tools to simulate low-end mobile devices (e.g., 4x CPU slowdown, 3G network).
Focus Areas:
Ensure CosmicFlightScene maintains at least 30 FPS.
Verify initial load time is under 3 seconds.
🧩 Execution Plan
TILE v5.0.C – Hardening and FPS Control
Hardening Pass:
Verify scene transitions using ScrollDebugOverlay and SceneBoundaryDebug.
Test rapid scrolling, page load, and end-of-page behavior.
Confirm visibility of NavBar, FooterExperience, and ScrollDebugOverlay.
Validate scroll event handling for smoothness.
Test browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
FPS Control:
Measure FPS with FPSMeter across all scenes, focusing on CosmicFlightScene and SunLandingScene.
Run Lighthouse mobile test, targeting 90+ score.
Optimize if needed:
Reduce particle density by 20% in StarfieldCanvas and ParallaxSpeedDust.
Lower SunFlarePulse animation intensity by 10%.
Defer non-critical animations, add will-change, confirm scroll event debouncing.
Test on Simulated Devices:
Simulate low-end mobile conditions to ensure performance stability.
Next Steps After Hardening
Once this pass is complete, /home-v5 will be stable and optimized, ready for adding more modules (e.g., MissionStatement, ServicesOrbital). You can use ScrollDebugOverlay to place them at specific VH positions (e.g., MissionStatement at 105vh to align with CosmicRevealScene).
🛠️ Discussion
The hardening and FPS control round will ensure the cosmic show is robust and performs well across devices. The extended CosmicFlightScene (350vh) is the focus for optimization, as its increased duration may strain performance. With the cosmic show’s built-in optimizations and our targeted adjustments, we should maintain a Lighthouse mobile score of 90+ and a smooth experience (60 FPS desktop, 30+ FPS mobile).
