Thank you for the detailed Current State & Implementation Analysis report, Commander. Let’s digest the findings, address the setbacks, and provide a refreshed plan to get Cursor back on track for TILE v5.0.D. The goal remains to deliver a seamless, movie-like scroll experience with fluid dissolve transitions and zero stutter at /home-v5, while resolving performance issues and ensuring compliance with the plan and LEGIT contracts.
🧠 Digest of Current State and Analysis
Current Implementation Status
Successfully Implemented:
dissolveEngine.js: Fully functional with proper fade zone calculations.
PersistentElements.jsx: Implemented with NebulaTrail, MotionLines, and ColorOverlay, though not fully verified against its contract.
useAnimationCurve.js: Implemented and in use for smooth transitions.
Mint-colored warp trails: Visible in CosmicFlightScene at z-40.
Moon appearance: Correctly positioned in DormantScene with improved texture.
Scene boundaries: Updated, though ranges have diverged slightly.
Z-Index Structure:
z-0: Base scenes container.
z-1: Active scene (CosmicFlightScene when active).
z-10: StarfieldCanvas.
z-20: ParallaxSpeedDust.
z-30: Constellations and GreenAuroraEffects.
z-35: CosmicFlightBackdrop (recent change).
z-40: Mint-colored warp trails.
z-50: Debug elements.
Plan Compliance Issues
Scene Ranges:
Divergence detected: DormantScene is 0% - 15% (0vh - 105vh) instead of the planned 0% - 5% (0vh - 35vh).
This affects all subsequent scenes and needs correction to match the original plan:
Planned: DormantScene (0% - 5%), AwakeningScene (5% - 15%), CosmicRevealScene (15% - 30%), CosmicFlightScene (30% - 80%), SunApproachScene (80% - 90%), SunLandingScene (90% - 100%).
LEGIT Compliance:
Metadata exists, but contract documents (contract_persistent_elements.md, contract_dissolve_engine.md, etc.) need validation and updates to reflect the current implementation.
Performance Concerns
CosmicFlightBackdrop:
Multiple canvas elements with requestAnimationFrame running simultaneously.
Complex nebula cloud paths (ctx.lineTo in loops) and gradient operations on every frame.
No FPS throttling for nebula animation.
ParallaxSpeedDust:
Canvas clearing/redraw on every frame.
Semi-transparent background causing cumulative repaints.
High particle count on high-density displays.
StarfieldCanvas:
High star counts on large screens/high DPI.
Shadow blur effects for larger stars (minor impact).
GreenAuroraEffects:
Heavy CSS filters (blur) and overlapping gradients.
CosmicJourneyController and Scene Management:
Multiple scenes rendered during transitions.
Lack of memoization for stable renders.
Potential excessive re-renders on scroll.
🚀 Refreshed TILE v5.0.D Plan for Cursor
Objective
Finalize the cosmic show at /home-v5 with fluid dissolve transitions, a seamless movie-like scroll experience, and zero stutter. Address performance issues, correct scene ranges, and ensure LEGIT compliance.
Steps for Cursor


Adjust getDissolveOpacity calls to reflect these corrected ranges.
Optimize Performance:
CosmicFlightBackdrop:
Implement FPS throttling for nebula animation (limit to 30 FPS, or 33ms per frame).
Move gradient operations to a one-time setup (e.g., create gradient once and reuse).
Simplify nebula cloud paths by reducing ctx.lineTo points (e.g., reduce from 100 points to 50 per cloud).
Use requestIdleCallback for non-critical animations (e.g., nebula updates when not in viewport).
ParallaxSpeedDust:
Avoid full canvas clearing on every frame; only clear affected areas.
Reduce repaint impact by removing semi-transparent background (use solid color or pre-rendered texture).
Cap particle count at 500 on high-density displays.
StarfieldCanvas:
Optimize shadow blur by applying only to 10% of stars (largest ones).
Further throttle rendering to 15 FPS (66ms per frame) for minor animations.
GreenAuroraEffects:
Add will-change: filter to CSS for better rendering performance.
Reduce blur radius by 20% (e.g., from 10px to 8px) to lessen GPU load.
CosmicJourneyController:
Add useCallback for scroll event handlers to prevent re-renders.
Use useMemo for particleConfig, opacity calculations, and animation curves.
Limit simultaneous scene rendering to 2 scenes during transitions (instead of 2-3) to reduce load.
Integrate and Verify Existing Components:
Verify useAnimationCurve:
Ensure it uses lerp, easeInOutSine, and mixColor as planned.
Confirm it’s applied to particle density, glow intensity, and ColorOverlay transitions.
Integrate PersistentElements:
Ensure <PersistentElements scrollProgress={scrollProgress} /> is mounted at z-20 in CosmicJourneyController.
Verify against contract_persistent_elements.md (update contract if needed).
Dissolve Transitions:
Confirm getDissolveOpacity is correctly calculating opacities with updated scene ranges.
Apply mix-blend-mode: screen and .fade-blend fallback during overlaps.
Update Z-Index Consistency:
Align with the planned structure:
z-0: Base scenes container.
z-1: Active scene.
z-10: StarfieldCanvas.
z-20: ParallaxSpeedDust and PersistentElements.
z-30: Constellations and GreenAuroraEffects.
z-35: CosmicFlightBackdrop (keep as-is, but note for future review).
z-40: Mint-colored warp trails.
z-50: Debug elements.
Ensure LEGIT Compliance:
Validate and update contract documents:
contract_persistent_elements.md: Reflect current PersistentElements implementation.
contract_dissolve_engine.md: Confirm alignment with dissolveEngine.js.
contract_animation_curve.md: Update if useAnimationCurve functionality has diverged.
Verify metadata in all components (CosmicJourneyController, PersistentElements, dissolveEngine, useAnimationCurve, useParticlePerformanceConfig).
Testing:
Seamless Flow:
Verify dissolve transitions at corrected scene boundaries (e.g., 4.5% - 5.5% for DormantScene → AwakeningScene).
Confirm lead-in/lead-out zones (e.g., Ursa Minor at 13%).
Zero Stutter:
Use FPSMeter to ensure 60 FPS desktop, 30+ FPS mobile.
Test rapid scrolling for no jank.
Simulate low-end mobile (4x CPU slowdown, 3G network).
Visual Continuity:
Check PersistentElements persists across scenes.
Verify smooth transitions via useAnimationCurve and ColorOverlay.
Performance:
Run Lighthouse mobile test, targeting 90+ score.
Monitor memory usage (<500MB) and battery impact (<5% per 10 minutes) using DevTools Performance monitor.
Cross-Browser Testing:
Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest and one version prior).
Devices: iPhone 14 (iOS 18), Samsung Galaxy A54 (Android 14), low-end simulation.
Fallback:
If FPS drops below 20 (mobile) or 40 (desktop) for 5 seconds, switch to simple opacity fades, reduce buffer to 200vh, and lower particle density/FPS.
🛠️ Discussion
This refreshed TILE v5.0.D plan addresses the setbacks by focusing Cursor on critical fixes:
Correcting scene ranges to match the original plan, ensuring CosmicFlightScene remains the focus.
Tackling performance issues with targeted optimizations (e.g., FPS throttling, canvas redraw reductions).
Validating and integrating existing components (PersistentElements, useAnimationCurve) with proper LEGIT compliance.
The plan minimizes disruption to the existing implementation while ensuring a seamless, movie-like scroll experience. Cursor should now have a clear path to finalize the cosmic show at /home-v5, ready for module placement in the next phase.
Do you approve this refreshed TILE v5.0.D plan for Cursor, or are there any final adjustments to help get things back on track? 🚀
