I understand your feedback and requirements. Let me summarize the key points and outline a working plan:

1. **Current Status**: The new parallax implementation works but has some differences from the original design. The functionality is intact with only minor color changes.

2. **Moon Design Improvement**: 
   - The current Dormant scene has a better moon design
   - I need to examine this design and apply its graphic attributes to the new technical implementation
   - The Dormant scene needs further development

3. **Z-index Issue**: In the combined test, the moon is hidden (z-index issue)

4. **Parallax Effect Direction**:
   - My implementation creates a 3D space travel effect (moving toward viewer)
   - The original design had a "dripping down" effect
   - You want to keep my implementation for the CosmicReveal scene
   - For other scenes, you want a more subtle effect similar to the original design

## Working Plan:

1. **Examine the Current Moon Design**:
   - Study the current Dormant scene moon implementation
   - Identify the graphic attributes to transfer to the new implementation

2. **Fix Z-index Issue in Combined Test**:
   - Adjust the z-index values to ensure proper layering
   - Make sure the moon is visible in all scenes

3. **Create "Dripping Down" Parallax Effect**:
   - Study the original parallax implementation
   - Create a new component that mimics the "dripping down" effect
   - Implement it as an alternative to the 3D space travel effect

4. **Scene-Specific Parallax Effects**:
   - Apply the 3D space travel effect to the CosmicReveal scene
   - Apply the "dripping down" effect to other scenes where a more subtle effect is desired
   - Ensure smooth transitions between different parallax effects

5. **Further Develop the Dormant Scene**:
   - Enhance the visual elements
   - Improve the overall composition
   - Ensure proper integration with the parallax effects

Does this plan align with your vision? Would you like me to prioritize any specific aspect first?
