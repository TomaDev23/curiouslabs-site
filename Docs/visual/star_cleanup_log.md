# Star Cleanup Process Log

## Overview
This document logs the cleanup process for non-STAR_LOCK star components as part of the TILE-STAR-CLEANUP initiative. The goal was to remove deprecated or conflicting star systems while preserving the components tagged with STAR_LOCK.

## Phase 1: Tagging Protected Components
The following components were tagged with the STAR_LOCK label to protect them from removal:

1. `src/components/visual/SpaceCanvas.jsx` - Used by the main homepage
2. `src/pages/products/index.jsx` - Used in products page (contains star background CSS)
3. `src/components/home/StarfieldBackground.jsx` - Used in home-v5
4. `src/legacy/cosmic-journey/CosmicRevealBackdrop_ThreeJS.jsx` - Used in cosmic-rev
5. `src/components/home/EnhancedSolarSystem.jsx` - Used in the legacy page
6. `src/pages/dev/parallax-test.jsx` - For parallax testing
7. `src/pages/dev/combined-parallax-test.jsx` - For combined parallax testing

## Phase 2: Removal of Non-STAR_LOCK Components

### Target Components for Removal
According to the cleanup plan, the following files were targeted for removal:

1. `src/components/journey/visual/StaticStarField.jsx` - Unmounted legacy canvas overlay
2. `src/components/visual/Stars.jsx` - Old R3F portal-based system
3. `src/components/journey/visual/CosmicStars.jsx` - Shader-based test system
4. `src/components/journey/visual/StarShellCanvas.jsx` - Half-ported equirect canvas layer

### Findings and Actions Taken

#### 1. File Existence Check
After a thorough search of the codebase, we found that:

- None of the targeted files exist in their specified paths
- No direct imports of these components were found in the codebase
- References to these components only appear in documentation and planning files

This suggests that these components may have been removed in a previous cleanup effort, or the paths specified in the plan are incorrect.

#### 2. Check for Import References
We checked for stale imports in the following files:

- `src/pages/dev/planet-sandbox.jsx` - Contains a comment "Stars background - REMOVED" indicating previous cleanup
- `src/pages/dev/mars-test.jsx` - No references to any star components
- `src/pages/test_canvas.jsx` - Only imports SpaceCanvas (which is STAR_LOCKED)
- `src/layouts/CodelabFloatflowLayout.jsx` - No references to any star components

#### 3. Search for Related Paths
Further searches for potential alternative locations did not yield any results for the targeted components.

### Conclusion
The cleanup process revealed that the targeted files for removal either:

1. Have already been removed in a previous cleanup effort
2. Exist under different paths not specified in the cleanup plan
3. Were never implemented beyond the planning phase

The absence of these files and import references suggests that this phase of the cleanup may have already been partially completed.

## Build Verification
After the cleanup investigation, we verified that:

1. No stale import references were found in the codebase
2. All STAR_LOCKED components remain intact and unmodified
3. The visual implementation continues to work as expected

## Next Steps
- Continue monitoring for any potential regressions
- Keep the STAR_LOCK system in place to prevent future conflicts
- Update documentation to reflect the current state of star components

## Completion
The TILE-STAR-CLEANUP Phase 2 is considered complete, with the understanding that the targeted components were already removed or do not exist in the specified paths.
