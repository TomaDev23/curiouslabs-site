<!-- Placeholder for favicon.ico -->
<!-- Replace this file with an actual .ico file -->
<!-- This is just a placeholder for demonstration purposes -->

<!-- This is a binary file, so we can't directly edit its content here.
For the purpose of this exercise, we're assuming that a proper favicon.ico file will be created and uploaded separately.
In a real-world scenario, you would create a favicon using a tool like favicon.io and upload the resulting .ico file. -->
