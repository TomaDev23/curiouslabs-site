# Render Conflict Report - TILE 5.9.D

## Findings Summary
- Is v4 interfering? âœ…
- Root cause: Experimental dev_v4_cosmic.jsx page mounted as main route with competing animation frames

## Route Configuration Issues
- Main route ('/'): Currently rendering DevV4CosmicPage instead of Home
- Legacy home route moved to '/legacy-home'
- Multiple routes pointing to same v4 components: '/dev/v4-cosmic', '/v4'

## Animation Frame Conflicts
- Multiple components using requestAnimationFrame:
  - SpaceCanvas.jsx - for star animations (found in src/components/home/v4/SpaceCanvas.jsx:176)
  - EnhancedSolarSystem.jsx - likely for orbital animations
  - ParticleField.jsx - for particle animations

## Component Import Issues
- SpaceCanvas imported in multiple locations:
  - dev_v4_cosmic.jsx (direct import)
  - Components using SpaceCanvas rendered in multiple routes

## Recommendations
- Restore correct route configuration: Set Home component as main route ('/')
- Move experimental pages to dedicated routes only: '/dev/v4-cosmic'
- Ensure SpaceCanvas is only rendered once in the component tree
- Implement animation frame synchronization to prevent competing frames
- Consider using React.memo or other optimization techniques for animation components
